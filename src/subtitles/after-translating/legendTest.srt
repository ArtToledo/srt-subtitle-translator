STILLWATER-IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH

7
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:51,816
What happens to the city
after we clean it up?

8
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:53,736
They will rebuild.

9
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,253
And will the population come back?

10
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,797
Most, yes.
It's crazy.

11
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:05,510
I think the Americans
don't like change.

12
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,750
But I think the tornado doesn't call
for what they like.

13
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:12,703
Thank you
for choosing Sonic.

14
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:14,639
My name is McKayla.
How can I help?

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,384
A cheese sandwich
with mustard and onion,

16
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:20,130
big potato
and large cherry lemonade.

17
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:32,080
We're on the road
showing to the people

18
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:34,697
the power strip-stains
from OxiClean.

19
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,066
Thank you, Lord,
for more this blessing.

20
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,430
Please,
protect always Ally.

21
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:41,875
In the name of Jesus. Amen.

22
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,499
You know how annoying that is?

23
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,766
And it can pop the eye
so.

24
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,696
-Where are you from?
-Stillwater.

25
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,714
In which drilling company
worked?

26
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:25,286
-ITA.
-Why did you leave?

27
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:29,472
The platform has been deactivated.
I was discharged six months ago.

28
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:32,493
-What are you doing now?
-Work with construction.

29
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:35,275
But it's slow
since the platform stopped.

30
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:38,903
I'm doing the cleaning,
after the tornado in Shawnee.

31
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:40,336
Running back.

32
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:54,193
-Hey, Sharon.
-Let me finish this page.

33
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,281
One more page.

34
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:05,342
Thank you for this food
and for all the best in this world.

35
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,154
Keep Allison
under Your protection.

36
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:10,045
-Amen.
-Amen.

37
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:15,475
-Have you ever been hired?
-No.

38
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,283
I had an interview
this morning.

39
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:23,467
Your mother called me
a few days ago.

40
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,594
She moved to Tampa.

41
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,346
She asked for money
or some shit like that?

42
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:31,426
No.
She asked for you.

43
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,460
Should call her
some day.

44
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,737
I already have too much trouble
at the moment.

45
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,795
You took the record
from my car?

46
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:45,317
Got it.
It's at home.

47
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,326
I stayed all morning
waiting.

48
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:54,032
I took it online.
Everything is online.

49
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:57,532
Don't find yourself a human being
for real not even if you try it.

50
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00,186
It didn't stop them
of they charge me 23 bucks.

51
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:02,070
I pay.

52
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:05,052
-That's not what I meant.
-I know.

53
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,562
There's a bag on the door
for you to take.

54
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,649
And an envelope with photos
at her desk.

55
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,337
That's important.

56
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:48,665
It will be two scales.

57
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,884
One in Atlanta,
afterward in Frankfurt.

58
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,963
-Gate 22.
-Thank you.

59
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:11,745
Let's start the landing
at the Marseille Airport.

60
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,166
I hope you enjoyed it
the flight.

61
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,875
Sign up here, please.

62
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,871
-Will stay for two weeks?
-Yes, ma'am.

63
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:50,711
Thank you.

64
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:54,085
Here's your key.
Room 156.

65
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:55,495
Thank you, lady.

66
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:58,795
Welcome back,
Mr. Baker.

67
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:01,532
Hi ...

68
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,678
Hey. Hey!

69
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,946
Could they put it down?
I'm trying to sleep.

70
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:38,545
The music.

71
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:41,795
No, no ... English.

72
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,741
-I don't speak English.
-Right.

73
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,248
Good night.

74
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,808
THE LIFE WE BURIED

75
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,101
Baker.

76
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,718
All right.

77
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,302
-Hi, little girl.
-Hi, Dad.

78
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,872
You look good.

79
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,883
Thank you.

80
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,612
-How was the flight?
-Good.

81
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:09,979
Are you okay?

82
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,489
-I'm, yeah.
-What a good one.

83
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,271
Do you have clothes to wash?

84
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:18,626
-I have some.
-I'll take care of it.

85
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,284
They gave us
plus two visits.

86
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,541
The next one is Friday,
at 14 o'clock.

87
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:27,971
How is Grandma?

88
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:29,666
She's fine.

89
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,659
Still uses
the oxygen tank.

90
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,368
Still have opinion
about everything.

91
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,859
I have longing for her.

92
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:40,087
She bought it
everything you wanted.

93
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:43,932
Have extra socks
and a new pair of sneakers.

94
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,018
Thank you.

95
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:50,028
Grandma said she was going to send
a few pictures for me.

96
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:52,494
Shit. I forgot.

97
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:53,933
Bring it next time.

98
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,415
No, I forgot at home,
in Stillwater.

99
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,082
-Sorry.
-It has no problem.

100
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,270
I bought a Cowboys sweatshirt
for you.

101
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:06,640
This year is going to be good for them.
There's a new player.

102
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,518
Need three guys
to topple him.

103
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,388
He must go
for the professional league.

104
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,983
Cool.

105
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,806
Still works
in the library?

106
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,492
No, I left.

107
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,820
Dad, I need you to do
one thing.

108
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:26,433
Give this to Leparq.
Make sure she reads it.

109
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:27,809
What is it?

110
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,681
It's a letter.
Just hand it to her.

111
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,234
The address is in the envelope,
is it ok?

112
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,640
It's fine.
But ... are you okay?

113
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:39,047
Parent ... Please.

114
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,985
I'll do it today.

115
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,758
I'll make sure
of which she reads.

116
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,146
It's fine.

117
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,745
Can we pray a little?

118
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,482
Sure, Dad.

119
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:55,672
Thank you, Lord, for gathering us
on this blessed day.

120
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:57,845
And thank you
for protecting Allison.

121
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,397
Mr. Baker.

122
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,465
Sorry for the delay,

123
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,971
but the Maître Leparq
will not return to the office today.

124
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,629
I come back tomorrow.
Thank you, lady.

125
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,070
Mr. Baker, she will be
on the court all week.

126
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:32,781
Why don't you give me your letter
and I deliver it to her?

127
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,559
I can't.
Thank you, lady.

128
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,903
As you like.

129
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,510
Hey.

130
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:56,679
Is it locked out here?

131
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:01,498
Key.
Do you have the key?

132
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,608
Come on, let's get it.

133
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:10,917
Come on.
Let's get a new key.

134
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,124
Bell?

135
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,995
-Bill.
-Beal?

136
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,102
Almost.
What's your name?

137
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,835
You.

138
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:32,223
-Maya.
-Maya. It's beautiful.

139
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,782
It's a tattoo.

140
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:45,164
-It's an eagle.
-Eagle?

141
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,342
Eagle-bald.
United States.

142
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,639
It's a skull
with a knife traversed.

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,505
Thank you, lady.

144
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:00,636
Thank you.

145
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:11,629
I'm looking for this person,
Maître Leparq.

146
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:33,766
Mrs. Leparq?

147
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,171
-Mr. Baker?
-Yes, ma'am.

148
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:38,864
Just need
of a few minutes.

149
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,868
A letter from my daughter.

150
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:45,265
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker,

151
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,727
but can't answer it
the request of your daughter.

152
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,727
Why not?

153
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:54,440
The judge will not reopen this case
based on indirect testimony.

154
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:56,019
That's not possible.

155
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:58,152
Right.

156
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,566
We sold out
all possible legal actions.

157
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:06,235
This letter tells me that your daughter
did not accept the sentence.

158
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:09,201
And she must accept it.
Do you understand?

159
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:10,945
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,930
I need to go.
I have a full day.

161
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:16,002
Can you give me back the letter?

162
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,595
-As you like.
-Thank you.

163
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:21,023
Mr. Baker,

164
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:24,207
there is moment for hope
and for acceptance.

165
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,887
The last thing
who will want to

166
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:28,141
is to give false hope
to your daughter.

167
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,142
It could get a lot worse
her situation.

168
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,654
Do you understand?

169
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,463
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,799
Hello.

171
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:05,788
Hey.

172
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:09,281
Thank you for helping
my daughter Maya yesterday.

173
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:11,470
I got late a little bit
to arrive.

174
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,434
We're moving,

175
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:18,646
and we have no electricity
in the new apartment. So ...

176
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,206
Sorry,
i don't speak english.

177
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:26,953
Ah, yes.
The balcony. Yes ...

178
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:30,738
My English has returned.

179
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:33,225
I'm sorry
by the loud noise.

180
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:35,014
It's my friend Nedjma.

181
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:36,970
She's a bad influence
for me.

182
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:40,564
-I'm Virginie.
-Bill.

183
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,985
Hello, Bill.

184
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:44,333
It's in Marseille
of holiday?

185
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:47,316
-I came to visit my daughter.
-How cool!

186
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:51,053
I hope to stay here
just for a few more days,

187
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:53,806
but if you need something,
we are in the door next door.

188
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:57,109
-Thank you, lady.
-Thank you. Bye, Bill.

189
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:05,599
" Cara Maître Leparq,

190
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,805
" I'm writing to you
because I was contacted

191
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:12,000
" by Dr. Patrick Okonedo,

192
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,897
" head of the program
of student assistance

193
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:17,693
" from which I was part
at the university.

194
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,941
" Patrick was approached
by a student

195
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:24,692
" who met a guy
called Akim at a party.

196
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,579
" He told her that years ago
had stabbed a girl

197
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,385
" and went out unpunished.

198
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:37,423
" It must be the same Akim
that killed Lina. "

199
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:43,370
You are the father of the girl,
the American student?

200
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,634
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:54,442
" His DNA
must be compared

202
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:57,412
" to unknown DNA
found at the scene.

203
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:00,499
" I implore you to investigate,

204
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,732
" and that speaks to Mr. Okonedo
and with the student.

205
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,895
" I'm innocent
of this crime,

206
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:09,554
" and I have no one else
to help me.

207
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:13,215
" My grandmother can't anymore
come to Marseille,

208
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:14,949
" and you know my father.

209
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:19,252
" I can't trust him
to help with that.

210
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:20,847
" He's not capable.

211
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:26,142
" Please don't abandon me
in this horrible place.

212
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,057
" I lost five years
of my life,

213
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:31,986
" and there are still four missing.

214
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:34,542
" Attentiously,
Allison Baker. "

215
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:38,631
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:40,477
I appreciate your help.

217
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:51,131
Please don't say anything
to no one about it.

218
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:04,760
Mr. Baker.
Come in, please.

219
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,494
How can I help you?

220
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:13,844
I want to talk to Ms. Leparq.
It's about the case.

221
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,889
Maître Leparq
is not available today.

222
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,580
There's a new track ...

223
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:22,814
This guy ...

224
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,868
was at a party
talking about the murder.

225
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,056
-Mr. Baker.
-Talk to this teacher,

226
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,586
Patrick Okonedo.

227
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:32,039
Need to hear
what he has to say.

228
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:35,738
Maître Leparq
was very clear with you yesterday.

229
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,863
She cannot proceed
in this case.

230
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:40,924
But if you wish
a further investigation,

231
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:42,828
we can recommend this ...

232
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,952
A list
of private detectives.

233
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,505
I don't want a detective.

234
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,493
We already work
with the people on the list,

235
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,389
and everyone is very capable.

236
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,969
I don't care
whether they are capable ...

237
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,217
-Circulated the names ...
-Stop it.

238
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,313
My daughter
is in the fucking prison.

239
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:59,116
Don't need
of a shit list.

240
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:13,059
As you like.

241
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,134
Fuck that.

242
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,470
-Hi.
-Hi.

243
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,707
-Are you okay?
-I'm, yeah.

244
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,270
You took it long today.
They shouldn't do that.

245
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,232
Go call it
back in the exact time.

246
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,121
All right.
It happens, sometimes.

247
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:48,328
-I washed your clothes.
-Thank you.

248
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:50,661
Delivered my letter
the Leparq?

249
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,396
Sure.

250
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:55,194
And what did she say?

251
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,403
Well, she told me
what you wrote

252
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,170
about Akim
and the girl from the party.

253
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,552
And what did she say?

254
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,832
She said she works
in many cases so ...

255
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,146
Parent ...

256
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,771
Will she investigate or not?

257
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,104
Just tell me.

258
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:18,083
Yes, she will investigate.

259
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,151
Seriously?

260
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:24,849
Did she say that?
Did she say she'll investigate?

261
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,592
That's right.

262
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,169
I told her how much this
is important to you.

263
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,819
-Does she need me to do something?
-No.

264
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,383
She said she just needs to
of some time, and ...

265
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:38,964
She said she didn't want to
promise nothing,

266
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:43,011
didn't want to give false hope
or something of the kind ...

267
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,762
No, no.
But that's still great.

268
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,255
Akim exists.

269
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,744
-He killed Lina.
-I know. I know that.

270
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:56,339
No idea how many times
wrote and rewrote that letter.

271
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:59,976
Well, it worked.
-Yes.

272
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:02,537
Maybe God has answered
our prayers.

273
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,944
Thank you, Dad.
Thank you so much.

274
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,053
Excuse me, lady.

275
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:26,335
Bill Baker.
I called because of a list.

276
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:28,568
One moment, please.

277
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,366
I don't know how much you remember
on the case,

278
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,497
but Allison make college
here,

279
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:35,975
and that's when she met
this girl, Lina.

280
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:38,799
Allison and Lina
were ... together,

281
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:42,649
and one night they fought ugly,
and Allison went to a bar.

282
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,874
That's when she met
this one from Akim.

283
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,381
They drank,
and he stole her purse and ...

284
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,468
when Allison
came home,

285
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:52,851
found Lina dead
and called the police.

286
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:55,149
And they never succeeded
find this Akim.

287
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,133
He was the one who killed Lina.

288
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:00,535
What do you think?

289
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,027
You speak English, don't you?

290
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,996
-English?
-Yes. I am.

291
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,390
Shit ...

292
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,517
Return the letter.

293
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:35,097
Mr. Baker.

294
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,430
Please.

295
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,166
My office.

296
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,105
I was on duty
at the time of that case.

297
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:46,257
In the police.

298
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:49,514
Already talked
with this one from Okonedo?

299
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,362
-The teacher.
-No, sir.

300
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,992
I see why your lawyer
doesn't want to help.

301
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,989
A girl at a party listens
a rumour about a murder.

302
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,210
Maybe she'll remember
of this famous case.

303
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:03,511
Why now?

304
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,485
That was 5 years ago.
It's ...

305
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:08,729
It's the time my daughter
is in prison, 5 years.

306
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:12,016
She knows
of this our date?

307
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:13,793
Your daughter.

308
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,461
No, sir.

309
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:23,322
Are you rich, Mr. Baker?

310
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,463
No, sir.

311
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,923
This case involves DNA.

312
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,004
That is, it is two steps.

313
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:32,820
First,
i look for the lad.

314
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,705
That won't be easy.

315
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,575
People will comment.
He will try to disappear.

316
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:40,748
And then,
if I find the Akim,

317
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,367
i have to get
a sample of his DNA,

318
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:45,708
and use my connections
in the police

319
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,991
to compare with DNA
from the scene of the crime.

320
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,494
What's the value?

321
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:00,890
12 thousand dollars?

322
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:03,068
Euros.

323
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:07,285
Thank you for your time.

324
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,301
Mr. Baker.

325
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,907
Do you believe that your daughter
is it innocent?

326
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:15,738
I know she is.

327
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:20,201
So maybe it's not so much
to see her free.

328
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:47,740
DEAR BILL,
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

329
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:49,299
GOOD LUCK IN MARSEILLE.

330
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,510
ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY
AIX-MARSEHA

331
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:08,277
-Excuse me, madam.
-Yes?

332
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:10,888
-Can I ask a question?
-Yes, sure.

333
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,921
I'm too dumb
to discover this alone.

334
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:17,074
-I don't speak French.
-How can I help you?

335
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:21,118
Looking for a guy
who works here.

336
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:31,898
... the Anthropocene

337
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:35,584
proposes that the man
is the driving force ...

338
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:39,528
-Yes?
-Sorry to interrupt.

339
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:42,569
Do you speak English?

340
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:46,305
I talk.

341
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:49,411
I'm looking
by Patrick Okonedo.

342
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:51,251
He found him.

343
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:54,855
-Sit down, please.
-All right. I hope out there.

344
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:57,193
No, no, please.
Join the party.

345
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:01,629
And this new era

346
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,739
is accompanied
by a depletion of resources,

347
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,675
a fort
climate instability

348
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:08,981
and a degradation
of the biosphere

349
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:12,275
by the acceleration of extension
of the life expectancy ...

350
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:14,883
It's impressive, isn't it?

351
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:19,783
This is the type of room
that you get with a PhD.

352
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:21,624
Mint tea.

353
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:26,665
I want to talk to the girl from whom
you talked to Allison at the party.

354
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:29,195
Yes. That's what I thought.

355
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,970
Being honest, always
felt guilty for what there was.

356
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:34,571
Should have alerted
to Allison.

357
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:36,800
Alerted? About what?

358
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:39,145
I knew that Allison and Lina
slept together,

359
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:41,734
but didn't know that Lina
had gone to live with her.

360
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,895
I try not to be cynical
about these relationships.

361
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,701
Poor girl from the periphery,
rich American student ...

362
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:50,480
But I wind up being naïve.

363
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:53,100
Allison grew up poor.
She's not rich.

364
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:54,501
Instructed.

365
00:26:55,223 --> 00:26:58,395
There are many resentments
in relation to the cultural elite.

366
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:00,347
But I'm sure
who is aware of this.

367
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,917
What about the party girl?

368
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:04,782
-My student?
-Yes.

369
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,119
Her name is Souad.
She is from the extension program,

370
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,136
the same in which Lina and Allison
were when they met.

371
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:13,687
And she heard a guy talking
of the murder of Lina?

372
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:15,393
That's what she told me.

373
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:17,519
Can I talk to her?

374
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:21,732
She'll talk to you, yes.
I'll give you the phone number.

375
00:27:22,797 --> 00:27:25,678
Souad does not speak English
very well.

376
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,580
You will need someone
to translate.

377
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,391
You could do it
by me?

378
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:33,446
No, I'd rather not.

379
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:37,080
Still command
the extension program,

380
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:38,773
i can't be associated
to you.

381
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,960
Or your daughter,
after what happened.

382
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,598
Whatever it is
my personal opinion.

383
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,756
My daughter is innocent.

384
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,506
I wish you good luck.

385
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:06,703
Patricia, I'm afraid I need
of your help again.

386
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:09,872
I have to go to a birthday
very special tomorrow,

387
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:11,693
and missed the address.

388
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:33,016
-Hello?
-Hi. It's Bill Baker.

389
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:36,143
-Forgiveness?
-Bill, from the hotel.

390
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:37,444
Bill!

391
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,396
I was going through here.
Sorry ...

392
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:43,172
-Last floor.
-It's fine.

393
00:28:45,363 --> 00:28:46,925
Hi, Bill.

394
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:48,830
Hi, Maya.

395
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:53,198
It brought something for you.
It's a robot.

396
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:59,188
A robot!
Mom, Bill brought me a robot!

397
00:28:59,189 --> 00:29:00,768
-Can I open it?
-Sure!

398
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,524
-Hi.
-Hi. Sorry to come without warning.

399
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:04,084
No, it's okay.
Come in.

400
00:29:05,262 --> 00:29:07,093
Some friends are here.

401
00:29:08,953 --> 00:29:10,475
How did you find us?

402
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:12,978
The lady at the reception
gave me his address.

403
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:16,123
I need to call a girl,
but she doesn't speak English,

404
00:29:16,124 --> 00:29:17,612
and it's kind of personal.

405
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:20,819
-Want me to call you?
-Yes, but I'll be back another time.

406
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,086
No, that's fine. Come in.
Let me just pick up my phone.

407
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:25,787
Come on.

408
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:28,375
Guys, that's the Bill.

409
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,600
-Hello, Bill.
-Hi.

410
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,516
Bill, this is ...

411
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:36,122
the cream of the theatrical scene
from Marseille.

412
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,755
-It's only going to take 5.
-Is that a break?

413
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,056
It is.

414
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,574
We're doing
an exercise with masks.

415
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,875
Right ...

416
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:48,988
Excuse the mess.
This will be my office,

417
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:51,073
but we're still moving.
Sit down.

418
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:53,323
So, who am I going to call?

419
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:56,956
The girl in the letter.

420
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:59,399
-Is it about the case?
-Yes, ma'am.

421
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,208
I want to meet with her.

422
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,572
The lawyer
is not helping?

423
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:06,213
I'm on my own,
at the moment.

424
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,108
All right.

425
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,012
-Maya, please turn on the light.
-Yes.

426
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:18,333
-It's in trouble again.
-No, again?

427
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:20,679
-Yes, see.
-Shit.

428
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,380
What a great deal. Got this
apartment through a friend.

429
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:29,503
I fell in love with this view,
but the place has some flaws.

430
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:33,123
It must be the circuit breaker.
I can take a look, if you want.

431
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,728
-Yes. Do you know to mess with that?
-Yes, ma'am.

432
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:37,269
Well, that would be great.

433
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:39,455
Souad? Souad?

434
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:41,814
Yes, hello. Souad?

435
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:43,688
Good morning.

436
00:30:46,665 --> 00:30:48,040
...Bill Baker.

437
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:49,766
Bill Baker ...

438
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:55,385
No!
The foot of the robot fell.

439
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,947
Let me see.

440
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:03,739
Cool.

441
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:08,988
I didn't know I did that.

442
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:13,096
Mom, my robot has already broken down.

443
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:14,590
I'm on the phone.

444
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:20,163
It's easy to ajetate.
There it is. Ready.

445
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,647
Pra that serves a robot
that does not stand?

446
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,342
Thank you so much.
Goodbye.

447
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:30,410
Very well. She agreed
on seeing him tomorrow at 18h.

448
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:33,567
-All right.
-She was kind.

449
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:35,278
A little timid.

450
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:38,246
How will you talk to her
if you don't speak French?

451
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:42,101
Well, it's a good question.
I'll give it a way.

452
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:46,483
Right. I could go
and translate if you need to.

453
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:48,114
Are you sure?

454
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:49,865
I have.

455
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,944
Maya has art class,

456
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:55,172
so if you come at 17h30,
let's go in my car.

457
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:57,467
Thank you.

458
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:59,301
Show where it gets
the fuse box,

459
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:00,895
for me to fix
the circuit breaker.

460
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:03,387
No, it's okay.
You don't need to do that.

461
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,152
No, no.

462
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:08,706
-Now fell an arm and leg.
-Give me that crap. Come on.

463
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:14,166
Bill!

464
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:17,761
Bye, Bill!

465
00:32:19,422 --> 00:32:20,822
Bye.

466
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:32,443
I have to confess,

467
00:32:32,444 --> 00:32:35,321
i researched on the internet
about the Allison case.

468
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,521
It was a famous case,
at the time.

469
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,698
The press was ferocious, no?

470
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:43,764
Do you guys say "ferocious"?

471
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:45,639
Yes, ma'am,
we say that.

472
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:50,213
-Idiot.
-Imbecile.

473
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,785
People don't know how to drive
in this fucking town.

474
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:55,774
It's a crazy place,
Marseille.

475
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,980
But I still prefer it here
than Paris.

476
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,601
People communicate
with each other here.

477
00:33:00,957 --> 00:33:02,831
In addition, it is cheaper.

478
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:08,178
And why Allison came here
to study? I'm curious.

479
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:09,980
-I don't know.
-Not?

480
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:13,107
She studied
at the University of Oklahoma,

481
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:14,864
called me one day and said:

482
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:16,716
"I'm going to France",
for here.

483
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,071
She is independent.

484
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:21,862
Yes, ma'am. It's always been.

485
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,764
Are you guys close?

486
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,080
Well, you read the letter.

487
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:29,626
And where is her mother?

488
00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:32,668
Passed away. He killed himself.

489
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,802
Allison was raised by her grandmother.
I wasn't very present.

490
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:41,203
Where were you?

491
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,722
Working
on oil rigs ...

492
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:46,769
and being an asshole,
when it wasn't working.

493
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:50,651
It's not easy
be a single parent.

494
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:53,307
I usually work at night
and Maya gets very upset.

495
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:55,312
-What do you do?
-I'm an actress.

496
00:33:55,313 --> 00:33:57,169
-On TV?
-No.

497
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,802
Theater.

498
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,924
-Do you go to the theater?
-No, ma'am.

499
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:05,544
-Never?
-No, ma'am.

500
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,733
It's fine.

501
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,730
Thank you
for talking to me.

502
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,029
So, this guy
that she met at the party, Akim,

503
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,521
could you tell us something
about him?

504
00:34:31,474 --> 00:34:33,955
She said he was quiet
and sympathetic.

505
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:35,256
Nice?

506
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:42,488
And he said her friend
who stabbed a girl

507
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,408
and that the police
never got him.

508
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,596
-Then ...
-All right.

509
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:48,261
Does she know where he lives?

510
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:49,665
Who is that?
His wife?

511
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:52,624
-No, I'm just a friend.
-I didn't talk to you.

512
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:55,669
Does she know where he lives?

513
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:01,238
-Kalliste.
-Kalliste?

514
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:04,987
She said he lives in a
another neighborhood, called Kalliste.

515
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,275
-Don't get me in trouble!
-I won't do that.

516
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:12,144
I live there! We don't know them!
Keep quiet!

517
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:14,271
How you know
that she is not from the police?

518
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:16,820
-I'm just trying to help you.
-I didn't talk to you.

519
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:19,109
-What is she saying?
-Nothing useful.

520
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:25,730
I'm ... the father
of Allison.

521
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,330
She's my girl.

522
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,915
Allison is my daughter.

523
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,821
Do you understand?

524
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:34,041
Explain this
to your colleague.

525
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,626
Things are like that
in Marseille.

526
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:37,144
The people
talk a lot of shit.

527
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:39,771
We don't know anything.
Tell him.

528
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,605
She doesn't want to help.

529
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:45,372
Can she tell me anything?
What's this guy like?

530
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,312
Didn't you understand?

531
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,647
You're already irritating me.
We're not god-hard!

532
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,548
Stand up. Let's go.

533
00:35:52,914 --> 00:35:54,882
-Where do they go?
-They're going away.

534
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:57,064
No, no.
Wait there, wait there.

535
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:59,954
What are you doing?
Let my friend!

536
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:02,466
Souad. Souad! Souad!

537
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,397
Bill, let them go.
She's scared.

538
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:06,067
Afraid of what?
We're talking.

539
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:07,755
Yes, but here
doesn't work like that.

540
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:10,920
So tell me how it works, because
no one here is helping me.

541
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,678
I'm helping you.

542
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,597
We better go. Now.

543
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:17,925
Is it okay?

544
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,500
-All right.
-All right?

545
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:31,302
It's here. Kalliste.

546
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:33,757
That's where she said
that Akim lives.

547
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:36,489
-Can we take a look?
-No.

548
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,017
Not at this hour.
It's not safe for us.

549
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,364
Because we're white?

550
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,323
Because we're not from here.

551
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:47,600
And the trafficking is intense.

552
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,660
I have to do
something.

553
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:51,811
No one will talk to you,
trust me.

554
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,750
Bill ...

555
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,166
-what if there is no Akim?
-There exists.

556
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:02,369
Right, but they never found him
during the investigation.

557
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,091
My daughter
is not a liar.

558
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:07,244
I didn't say she was.
But everything I read about the case ...

559
00:37:07,245 --> 00:37:09,036
So you're an expert
now?

560
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,589
No, I'm not.

561
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:18,896
The press
was against us.

562
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:22,166
The only thing
that mattered to them

563
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,767
was that Allison was sleeping
with an Arab girl.

564
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,099
Bunch of ...

565
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,632
disseminating scoundrels
from fake news.

566
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:33,157
That's why it punched
that English reporter?

567
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:36,952
I was drinking
on the occasion.

568
00:37:48,044 --> 00:37:50,119
You told Grandma
about Leparq?

569
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:54,576
No. Didn't want to give hopes
to her until we knew more.

570
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:57,342
She's aging,
your grandmother.

571
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,459
Had a meeting
with the judge yesterday.

572
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,510
Was it? About what?

573
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:07,069
My review of the parole
will be three months from now.

574
00:38:07,478 --> 00:38:11,013
E. .. is when I can
get out of here one day a month.

575
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:13,392
Right. What did he say?

576
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:15,101
She. She said ...

577
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,575
While my behavior
stay good,

578
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:19,955
should not be a problem.

579
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,763
I had the urge to say:
" Fuck parole.

580
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:25,974
" My lawyer is taking care
to get me out of here at a time. "

581
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:27,498
No, we don't know yet,
Ally.

582
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,512
-You have to keep ...
-I know, Dad.

583
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,743
I didn't say that.
But I wanted to.

584
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,903
E. .. someone from the office
of the Leparq was there.

585
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:37,894
Even?

586
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:40,253
Yes. I don't know her,
but ...

587
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:43,054
i asked her
as was going the investigation.

588
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:45,528
What did she say?

589
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:47,425
She said
who knew nothing,

590
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:50,143
but also said
who started working there now.

591
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:54,258
Leparq must be taking care
of this alone. It's a big case.

592
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:57,540
I told her
who wanted to talk to Leparq.

593
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:00,038
She should keep us informed.
You understand?

594
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,539
I'm going to talk to her.

595
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:03,781
It ended the time.

596
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:05,827
Right. Well ...

597
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,420
We see you in a couple of days.

598
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:11,708
Dad, do you think you could stay
a little more in Marseille?

599
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:13,777
Should something arise.

600
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:16,194
Yes, I can stay.

601
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:18,924
Just gonna talk
with the staff of the work.

602
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,502
Can I ask Granny to send
some money.

603
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:24,372
No, it doesn't need to.
I turn.

604
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:26,307
Thank you, Dad.

605
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:28,174
Bye.

606
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,508
Max.

607
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,159
Hello.

608
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:22,923
Here they are.
All the tools.

609
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:24,848
You can use them.

610
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:27,275
Bring them back
when it ends.

611
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:35,695
The electric frame.

612
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:38,822
What's there?

613
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:41,572
It's closed.

614
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:44,621
Understood?

615
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,820
Understood.

616
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,740
As soon as the oil tanker
gets the concession ...

617
00:40:54,741 --> 00:40:57,047
Give it here, M. Let's go.

618
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:00,975
As soon as the oil tanker
gets the concession,

619
00:41:00,976 --> 00:41:03,025
they hire
a drilling company,

620
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:04,631
which is for whom
i work.

621
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:08,540
And when we got there,
we organize and assemblies everything.

622
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,827
After all mounted,

623
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:12,892
we started drilling.

624
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:15,978
That's what a labourer does.
We drilled.

625
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:18,151
All right, test.

626
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:21,250
Go ahead, flush it out.

627
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,842
-Let's go. Give discharge.
-The discharge.

628
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,330
-Gave it right?
-Of course I do, ça va!

629
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:39,917
Bill, come. Come here.
Come see this.

630
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:42,568
Nedjma is a genius
of the technology.

631
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,748
I'm not a genius.
I'm just younger.

632
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,946
-Three years!
-But it counts.

633
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:49,146
Is this all from the internet?

634
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:51,359
All of this is from the accounts
from Instagram

635
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,194
from Souad
and of your coarse friend.

636
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:55,380
And all these pictures
are from the party.

637
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,110
How did you guys manage?

638
00:41:57,111 --> 00:41:59,243
I created a fake account
on Instagram,

639
00:41:59,244 --> 00:42:02,203
segui Souad and his lovely friend
whose name is Samira,

640
00:42:02,204 --> 00:42:05,763
so I scored the party in which
Souad was when he saw this guy.

641
00:42:05,764 --> 00:42:09,544
Then there's a chance of Akim
be in one of these photos.

642
00:42:09,545 --> 00:42:13,843
-How is he?
-He says it's high,

643
00:42:13,844 --> 00:42:15,834
Arabic and light skin.

644
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:17,886
Yes, light and high skin.

645
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,113
What he means to say
with "clear skin"?

646
00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:22,549
This does not mean anything.
What am I then?

647
00:42:22,968 --> 00:42:24,491
You're talking trash.

648
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:27,917
Let's print them, and you can
show them to Allison.

649
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,156
No, I'm not going to do that.

650
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,008
Why? If Akim appears,
she will recognize him.

651
00:42:33,836 --> 00:42:35,962
I don't care.
I'm not going to do that.

652
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:38,530
I'm not going to do that to her.
I have to protect her.

653
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,787
I don't get it.

654
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:43,366
Why you're being
so stubborn with Allison?

655
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:46,856
We should go back to talking to Souad,
now that we have these photos.

656
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:49,555
Well, we stole
these Instagram photos,

657
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:51,288
so don't know
if it's a good idea.

658
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:55,314
-Well ...
-Can I say one thing?

659
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:56,625
Yes, it can.

660
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:59,336
Someone else in Marseille
saw this one from Akim,

661
00:42:59,337 --> 00:43:00,860
or just Allison?

662
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,960
The owner of the bar ...
where they met.

663
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,349
He was at the trial.

664
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,521
-He didn't do anything, but ...
-All right.

665
00:43:07,522 --> 00:43:09,920
What is the name of the bar?

666
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,051
I don't remember the name.
It was close to her apartment.

667
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:14,802
Right. All right.

668
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:18,041
So this is your new cause,
is not it?

669
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:21,937
It was already the zero waste,
the refugees and now he.

670
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:23,638
Stop, please.

671
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:27,109
What's the problem? You love it.
It's your weird hobby.

672
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:31,111
-Enough is enough.
-Ask him then.

673
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:32,961
I've talked about it doesn't matter.

674
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:37,238
Bill, did you vote for Trump?

675
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,600
No.

676
00:43:40,524 --> 00:43:41,924
Voilà.

677
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:44,747
-I didn't vote.
-What?

678
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,554
-Why didn't you vote?
-I'm booked.

679
00:43:47,555 --> 00:43:49,119
I was arrested.

680
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:51,946
You can't vote
when that happens.

681
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:54,174
What a great one.

682
00:43:54,608 --> 00:43:56,108
An ex-convict.

683
00:43:59,676 --> 00:44:02,444
Good luck.
You'll need it.

684
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,326
It's there, around the corner.

685
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,868
Your friend, Nedjma ...

686
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:19,816
she's mad at you
for helping me?

687
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,478
Don't worry about Nedjma,
she is usually hostile.

688
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:27,564
It's very protective of me,
but it's a good friend.

689
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,142
She helps me with Maya.

690
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:31,995
Where is the father of Maya?

691
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:35,917
Corsica,
managing a nightclub on the beach.

692
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:38,516
He was an adventure.

693
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:40,570
-Is that how you say it?
-That, adventure.

694
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:43,226
Does he visit you?

695
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:46,025
He visited,
but it's better when it doesn't.

696
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:49,582
What was it?

697
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:52,732
Allison lived here.

698
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:56,628
No. 21.

699
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,639
Is that where it happened?

700
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,889
It was.

701
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:11,647
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

702
00:45:11,648 --> 00:45:15,538
-Procuro the owner of the bar.
-It's me.

703
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,065
We need information.
Was it the owner 5 years ago?

704
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:22,881
No, we took over the bar
past year.

705
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,493
He's the new owner.

706
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:27,642
It wasn't here
when the crime happened.

707
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:30,661
He knows where we can find
the former owner?

708
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:32,162
Yes, I know.

709
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:33,881
He's right there.

710
00:45:34,282 --> 00:45:35,888
Drinking my profits.

711
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,733
It's terrible what happened
with your daughter.

712
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:42,715
I still don't understand
how they could send

713
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:44,808
a beautiful girl like her
for the prison.

714
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:48,496
See all this rabble.

715
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:54,185
Some of them
sounds familiar to you?

716
00:45:54,828 --> 00:45:57,354
Hard to say.
Everyone looks the same.

717
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,098
Does he recognize anyone?

718
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,820
They come here
and always cause confusion.

719
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:04,791
As if Marseille
be theirs.

720
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:08,091
We can focus
in the photos, please?

721
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:11,705
We are both equal.

722
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:14,080
You guys have the same problems
with the Mexicans.

723
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:15,880
It's an invasion too.

724
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:17,281
What is he saying?

725
00:46:17,604 --> 00:46:21,290
You can look at the pictures
with attention, please?

726
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:24,607
Listen, you show me the guy
who wants in the picture,

727
00:46:24,608 --> 00:46:27,620
and I will say that I recognize him.
And it's done.

728
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,880
And I will say the same thing
in the court.

729
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:31,981
Wait,
this is a serious matter.

730
00:46:31,982 --> 00:46:33,483
But take a look,

731
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:36,018
all of them are to blame
of something.

732
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:39,113
What an idiot.
It's fine. Let's go.

733
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,115
-What did he say?
-Nothing. He's useless.

734
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:44,794
-Thank you, creep.
-Goodbye, lady.

735
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:53,848
What was there?

736
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:57,014
I'm sorry. I can't get it
more talk to that guy.

737
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,934
He was saying
horrible things.

738
00:46:58,935 --> 00:47:00,262
Like what?

739
00:47:00,263 --> 00:47:02,759
He just wants to send
an Arab boy for jail.

740
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,315
He doesn't care
with which.

741
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,598
Is that it?

742
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:10,580
What do you mean by "that's it"?
He's racist.

743
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:13,659
Right, he's racist.
We still have to talk to him.

744
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,761
No.
I'm not going to talk to him.

745
00:47:15,762 --> 00:47:18,792
-He may know of something.
-No, he doesn't know anything!

746
00:47:18,793 --> 00:47:21,334
Let's not send
an innocent boy for the prison.

747
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:23,378
My daughter is innocent.

748
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:26,342
Fuck. Don't believe
that we're having this conversation.

749
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,127
You must live
in an enchanted world, dear,

750
00:47:29,128 --> 00:47:31,185
because i work
with lots of guys like that.

751
00:47:31,186 --> 00:47:34,192
-But it doesn't matter. It's not right.
-I'm not saying it's ...

752
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:37,259
Everything I care about
is to get my daughter out of prison.

753
00:47:37,664 --> 00:47:41,502
-Sounds very American, now.
-Great. I'm even.

754
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:44,479
And it's also a stranger here.
It doesn't understand anything.

755
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,749
Want to know? Get your things.
Do what you want, but without me.

756
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:12,212
Mr. Baker,
a moment, please.

757
00:48:12,213 --> 00:48:13,972
You have a message.

758
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:16,954
She said you need
of more money

759
00:48:16,955 --> 00:48:19,010
Because Leparq ...
reopened the case?

760
00:48:19,011 --> 00:48:22,041
-I'm taking care of it, Sharon.
-Caring for what?

761
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:25,378
Nothing. Allison asked me
to deliver a letter to her.

762
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:27,852
I delivered, and now
Leparq is investigating.

763
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:30,507
She's looking for
by Akim again?

764
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,984
I said I'm
taking care of it, Sharon.

765
00:48:32,985 --> 00:48:34,404
Who's going to pay for it?

766
00:48:34,405 --> 00:48:36,876
No one is talking
about money. Is it okay?

767
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:40,301
-Bill, have you been drinking?
-No!

768
00:48:40,302 --> 00:48:43,560
-Sharon, I'm her father.
-My God, Bill.

769
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:46,943
Should just visit her and come back
for home. Forget that.

770
00:48:46,944 --> 00:48:48,821
You'll need
trust me.

771
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:51,758
Just enough.
I'll call Leparq.

772
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:54,219
No, don't do that, Sharon.
Sharon!

773
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,360
Dad, what's going on?

774
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:11,419
Grandma said you
is very strange.

775
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,348
I just need you to trust me,
right?

776
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:15,428
I need you to
look at these photos.

777
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,423
Dad? Parent ...

778
00:49:19,472 --> 00:49:23,087
-have you been drinking?
-What? No, ever!

779
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:24,632
Are you drugging?

780
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:27,169
Ally, I stopped with this shit.
You know that.

781
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,903
Come on, look at these photos.

782
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:31,376
What the fuck is that?
Where is Leparq?

783
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:34,230
Just look at the pictures
and tell me if you see the Akim!

784
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,272
I think he shows up
at some.

785
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,417
Please, honey.

786
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:43,063
Please.

787
00:49:44,688 --> 00:49:46,088
Please.

788
00:49:55,487 --> 00:49:57,945
-No, I don't see him.
-All right. There's more.

789
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,895
There's more.

790
00:50:12,504 --> 00:50:13,904
My our.

791
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:18,357
-My our.
-Do you see him? Which one?

792
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:19,735
It's him.

793
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:21,986
It's him. It's the Akim!

794
00:50:21,987 --> 00:50:24,493
Are you sure?
Is that the guy of that night?

795
00:50:24,494 --> 00:50:26,824
Dad, it's him.

796
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:34,940
Kalliste? Are you sure?

797
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,622
Yes. To there.

798
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:39,879
Just take me there.

799
00:50:47,908 --> 00:50:49,308
Thank you.

800
00:51:03,676 --> 00:51:06,989
Excuse me, lady.
Have you seen this lad before?

801
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:10,284
-Akim? He lives here. No?
-No. No.

802
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,479
Lady, have you seen him before?
Akim?

803
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:19,033
Excuse me, sir.

804
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,379
-Have you seen this lad before?
-No.

805
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,382
What about you? Have you seen it before?
-No.

806
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,364
-I'm looking for this lad. Akim.
-No.

807
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:34,700
-Do you know him? Akim?
-No.

808
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,618
Excuse me.
Do you guys know this lad?

809
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:50,225
This one? Akim?

810
00:51:50,226 --> 00:51:51,726
Don't ...

811
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,275
Have you seen this lad?

812
00:52:06,276 --> 00:52:08,818
-Akim?
-No, no, no.

813
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:10,882
This lad? No?

814
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:32,408
Hey, do you know this lad?
Here? Akim?

815
00:52:32,409 --> 00:52:33,775
Do you know him?

816
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:35,715
This lad, Akim,
does he live here?

817
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,680
No, no.

818
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:40,146
And you -- Akim?

819
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,983
No.

820
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:44,550
Tchauzinho, cowboy.

821
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:16,152
A tourist!
Is it lost?

822
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:17,844
Do you speak English?

823
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:19,689
If you are looking for the old port,
is not here!

824
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:22,545
Do you know this lad?
This ... It's called Akim.

825
00:53:22,546 --> 00:53:23,855
Does he live here?

826
00:53:23,856 --> 00:53:25,578
Who is it? Your bitch?

827
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:27,115
The lad lives here.

828
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:29,356
It's his bitch.

829
00:53:31,445 --> 00:53:33,903
He doesn't speak French,
speaks English.

830
00:53:33,904 --> 00:53:36,285
I speak English.
Suck my dick.

831
00:53:41,856 --> 00:53:44,698
See, I fight Karate.
It's like that ...

832
00:54:04,999 --> 00:54:07,199
What are they doing?
Is it serious?

833
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,700
Calm, calm.

834
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:12,379
-It was him. He who started it.
-Shut up that mouth!

835
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,680
Who is he?

836
00:54:14,026 --> 00:54:17,064
-It was showing this picture.
-Must be an informant.

837
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:20,263
-He was xeretting.
-Shit.

838
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:25,867
Do you know him?

839
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:31,015
-No, I don't know.
-Why does he have your picture?

840
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,525
No, I know, I don't know him.

841
00:54:39,035 --> 00:54:40,435
I have no idea.

842
00:54:40,818 --> 00:54:42,218
It goes, it falls out of here.

843
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:44,219
-Take him from here.
-Where to?

844
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,220
For the post. The post.

845
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:55,681
Come on!

846
00:55:07,898 --> 00:55:09,500
-For here.
-Thank you.

847
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:14,661
Hi.

848
00:55:17,307 --> 00:55:19,396
They asked
if I knew anyone.

849
00:55:20,724 --> 00:55:22,143
Are you okay?

850
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,701
I saw him.

851
00:55:25,237 --> 00:55:26,860
I saw the Akim.

852
00:55:27,504 --> 00:55:28,937
In Kalliste.

853
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,021
Did you tell the police?

854
00:55:37,697 --> 00:55:39,256
It was my chance.

855
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,521
It was my chance.

856
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:22,315
What the hell did you do?

857
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:24,060
It was trying to help.

858
00:56:24,061 --> 00:56:25,794
Say exactly what you did,
parent.

859
00:56:27,504 --> 00:56:28,922
Father!

860
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:31,956
She wouldn't, Ally.

861
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,350
Leparq was not going to investigate
the case

862
00:56:37,142 --> 00:56:38,682
My God.

863
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:41,579
You lied!

864
00:56:43,298 --> 00:56:44,795
About everything.

865
00:56:45,638 --> 00:56:48,708
-Of course you lied ...
-I found him, Ally.

866
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:51,287
I found Akim.

867
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:53,713
And why didn't you call
the police?

868
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:55,819
Why?

869
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,087
Why?

870
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:03,056
You let him escape!
Now he's gone!

871
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:05,146
If it was!

872
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,498
I feel so dumb!
I feel so dumb!

873
00:57:09,499 --> 00:57:13,393
You've always lied to me!
My whole life, always!

874
00:57:13,737 --> 00:57:17,140
I hate myself
for trusting you!

875
00:57:18,575 --> 00:57:21,175
Guard! Guard!

876
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:22,676
I want to get out!

877
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:27,311
-Ally, listen to me.
-No! No! No!

878
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:31,921
You screwed
with my life.

879
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:34,676
Do you understand that?

880
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:37,605
You understand?

881
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:41,017
Stay away from me.

882
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:54,883
FOUR MONTHS LATER

883
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:04,154
Bill! Bill! Bill.

884
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:08,758
Hey, guys ...

885
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,287
Hey, Bill.

886
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,925
Yes, I get it.

887
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:12,197
-Hi, Bill!
-How are we?

888
00:59:12,198 --> 00:59:14,440
How was the school? Well?
Did everything?

889
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:17,843
Let's go. Yes, I pick it up.

890
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:19,345
Here. I brought you this.

891
00:59:22,995 --> 00:59:26,577
-Maya, has to eat everything.
-No, I prefer the chocolate.

892
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:30,300
I know what you're doing,
but it has to eat the bread too.

893
00:59:31,224 --> 00:59:32,924
Yes, see ...

894
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:35,491
Take it. Eat.

895
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:38,582
Will it push for me?
Right ...

896
00:59:43,874 --> 00:59:45,197
Bill.

897
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:49,079
A hammer.

898
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,794
Yes. Very well.
Hammer. Ramér.

899
00:59:51,795 --> 00:59:53,283
Hammer!

900
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,901
Formon ...

901
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,146
Form something ...

902
01:00:00,147 --> 01:00:02,796
-Forhand for wood.
-Forhand for wood.

903
01:00:02,797 --> 01:00:05,151
It's too much word
for a formon.

904
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:07,440
-Forhand.
-Let's go, erase the light

905
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,970
-Lumière.
-Lumière.

906
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:21,298
Maya, food ...

907
01:00:23,126 --> 01:00:24,445
Maya.

908
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:26,646
Wait. They'll open up.

909
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,188
That balding
will lose the dough.

910
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,409
-No!
-Yeah, it's how they do it.

911
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,844
Commercials
before the big revelation.

912
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:44,174
Come on, let's eat.
Come on.

913
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:48,869
Did you do your homework?

914
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,755
-Homework?
-No.

915
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:53,826
Well,
thank you for honesty.

916
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:56,028
I hated the school
also.

917
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:57,456
I hated everything.

918
01:00:57,457 --> 01:00:59,184
I stopped in high school,

919
01:00:59,185 --> 01:01:01,182
worked on platform,
as my father ...

920
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,092
I started drilling wells.

921
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:05,429
Is that what you want to do?
Making wells?

922
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,301
-Yes, I will make wells.
-Don't play.

923
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:10,272
It has to start as wormworm,
know ...

924
01:01:10,273 --> 01:01:12,666
It's the lowest point.
A wormworm.

925
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:13,995
No, minhoca no.

926
01:01:13,996 --> 01:01:16,409
I'll work in the tower
of drilling, like you.

927
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:17,833
Want to go straight
to the tower?

928
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,409
You have to have claw.

929
01:01:19,952 --> 01:01:21,432
Do you have a claw?

930
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:22,839
Yes.

931
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,741
Thank you, Lord,
for this and other blessings.

932
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:33,421
Please take care of Ally.
Keep an eye on her.

933
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:35,786
We ask in the name of Jesus,
Amen.

934
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:37,809
-Skating!
-Skating.

935
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,762
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, Mommy.

936
01:01:46,997 --> 01:01:49,013
-Have a hamburger, if you like.
-Thank you.

937
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,888
For me?

938
01:01:51,889 --> 01:01:54,530
-Yes, ma'am. It's the rent.
-Thank you.

939
01:01:57,224 --> 01:01:59,209
Can pass the ketchup,
Please?

940
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:02,855
Did you do your homework?

941
01:02:03,256 --> 01:02:04,623
No.

942
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:06,633
After dinner.

943
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:08,305
-Yes.
-Thank you.

944
01:02:08,306 --> 01:02:10,881
Bill, she has to do
the homework.

945
01:02:11,325 --> 01:02:13,345
I know. I agree 100%.

946
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:15,307
Do your homework.

947
01:02:16,896 --> 01:02:18,368
Right?

948
01:02:18,911 --> 01:02:20,226
Thank you.

949
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,129
When I see what you eat,
understand why prays before.

950
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:28,181
-How was the practice of the play?
-Rehearsal.

951
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:30,893
It was crap.

952
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:33,896
We did a lot of stage writing,
so it was a mess.

953
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:37,643
And the director is young
and provinciano.

954
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,676
What is stage writing?

955
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:44,106
We don't know what to do,
so we invented it.

956
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:46,331
-Legal.
-Legal Marchal.

957
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,113
Fall to the back,
camwhale up to the middle.

958
01:02:52,114 --> 01:02:55,247
Within ten,
the clock is ticking,

959
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:56,597
the clock is ticking.

960
01:02:58,368 --> 01:02:59,752
To bed!

961
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:01,632
Watch it with you?

962
01:03:02,076 --> 01:03:03,469
Not at all.

963
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,144
Bed.

964
01:03:05,488 --> 01:03:07,033
It's going to get me in trouble.

965
01:03:07,377 --> 01:03:08,696
It's my tablet.

966
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,177
Yes, I'm using it.
Bed, now.

967
01:03:38,674 --> 01:03:40,136
Yes, it's him.

968
01:03:41,964 --> 01:03:43,492
It's a day out.

969
01:03:43,935 --> 01:03:47,298
She leaves in the morning,
and goes back to prison at night.

970
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:50,780
If all goes well, she will have
another day the following month.

971
01:03:50,781 --> 01:03:52,926
The idea is that the detainees
aclimatem

972
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:54,755
to the outside world
again.

973
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:57,096
-Understood?
-Yes, ma'am.

974
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,809
The judge requires a chaperone,

975
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,246
someone who will be
her assurance.

976
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,349
Did she ask for me?

977
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,469
No.

978
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:11,072
But you're the only option.

979
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:15,171
Right. Allison doesn't talk to me
there are more than four months.

980
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:17,465
I know.

981
01:04:19,262 --> 01:04:20,802
Mr. Baker,

982
01:04:20,803 --> 01:04:23,335
do not take any initiative
this time.

983
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:24,998
Understood?

984
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:27,731
Yes, ma'am.

985
01:05:09,303 --> 01:05:11,165
What is her favorite color?

986
01:05:12,202 --> 01:05:13,760
Color that she loves ...

987
01:05:14,404 --> 01:05:15,971
Her favorite color?

988
01:05:15,972 --> 01:05:18,364
-That, favorite!
-I don't know for sure.

989
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,689
Hey, Maya?

990
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:28,144
No.

991
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,531
I think it's beautiful.

992
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:36,197
Bill! Bill! Come see!

993
01:05:38,403 --> 01:05:40,584
She lives in Marseille!
Loves football.

994
01:05:40,585 --> 01:05:42,426
Allison is like
the state of Oklahoma.

995
01:05:42,427 --> 01:05:43,855
Likes football
for real.

996
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,677
This is football,
the favorite game.

997
01:05:45,678 --> 01:05:47,624
No, these guys
are a bunch of babies.

998
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:49,017
A bunch of crimping babies.

999
01:05:49,018 --> 01:05:51,789
They're not babies.
It's the best team in the world!

1000
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,425
It has a lot of great players:
Payet, Thauvin, Sakai!

1001
01:05:54,426 --> 01:05:56,546
All right, don't be nervous.
How much is it?

1002
01:05:56,547 --> 01:05:59,367
And we're in the middle of the streets,
and the musicians follow playing.

1003
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:01,868
They do percussion
and everyone will sing with the audience.

1004
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:03,179
Mama.

1005
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,435
Mom, look!
The Bill bought me a T-shirt!

1006
01:06:06,436 --> 01:06:08,831
Wow! Did you thank you?

1007
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:10,155
Don't ...

1008
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,091
Thank you, Bill.

1009
01:06:12,092 --> 01:06:13,942
-Right
-Thank you, Bill.

1010
01:06:13,943 --> 01:06:15,803
-Maya, remember the Renaud?
-Yes.

1011
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:17,742
-Hi, Maya.
-Hi.

1012
01:06:18,786 --> 01:06:20,987
Hi. You must be the Bill.

1013
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:23,495
-Yes, sir. Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

1014
01:06:24,739 --> 01:06:27,656
Virginie told me
that you are from Oklahoma.

1015
01:06:27,999 --> 01:06:29,405
That's really cool.

1016
01:06:30,898 --> 01:06:32,234
Right ...

1017
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:34,988
Renaud is a director
towards stardom.

1018
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,342
It's me.

1019
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:38,788
You are what you do
the stage writing?

1020
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:41,299
Yes. You know
stage writing?

1021
01:06:41,943 --> 01:06:45,595
Great. You know, man,
i love working like that.

1022
01:06:45,596 --> 01:06:46,969
It's real, you know?

1023
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:49,239
Stage writing?
It's true.

1024
01:06:50,182 --> 01:06:52,184
It comes from life.

1025
01:06:53,503 --> 01:06:55,456
Virginie has been telling me
about respect, no?

1026
01:06:55,457 --> 01:06:57,059
Yes. Thank you, Bill ...

1027
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,021
Help me with the table?
The dinner is ...

1028
01:07:00,022 --> 01:07:02,143
-Yes, you can let it.
-Thank you, Bill.

1029
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:05,671
It's serious.
Pra me makes every sense.

1030
01:07:05,672 --> 01:07:07,369
The people
should be able to have guns.

1031
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,935
As you like.

1032
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:11,403
It's freedom.
Fundamental freedom.

1033
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:13,075
I'd love to have a gun.

1034
01:07:13,439 --> 01:07:15,439
You already have a trumpet!

1035
01:07:15,891 --> 01:07:17,813
I'm right
of who has a gun.

1036
01:07:17,814 --> 01:07:20,333
-Don't have, Bill?
-Yes, sir. I have it.

1037
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:23,005
-That!
-No, you don't have it.

1038
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:24,907
Why wouldn't you?
I have two.

1039
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:26,510
I have a shotgun
and a Glock.

1040
01:07:26,854 --> 01:07:29,104
-No, shit. It's not true!
-Two! Perfect!

1041
01:07:29,105 --> 01:07:31,653
No, for...
All right, all right.

1042
01:07:31,654 --> 01:07:33,003
It's your ...

1043
01:07:33,004 --> 01:07:35,252
-It's his culture.
-Culture ...

1044
01:07:35,253 --> 01:07:36,964
Culture is a broad concept,
no?

1045
01:07:38,548 --> 01:07:40,488
I'll shut down for today,
people.

1046
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,316
What is it, Bill. It's early.

1047
01:07:42,317 --> 01:07:44,449
-I'll put Maya in bed.
-I can do that.

1048
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:46,138
-I do.
-Right.

1049
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,836
You're my favorite.

1050
01:07:54,664 --> 01:07:56,144
Favorite what?

1051
01:07:57,071 --> 01:07:58,921
Favorite American.

1052
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:06,263
Good dreams, little girl.

1053
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:37,495
You know it's Sunday morning,
no?

1054
01:08:37,938 --> 01:08:39,417
Where's your friend?

1055
01:08:40,243 --> 01:08:41,767
He left early on.

1056
01:08:44,714 --> 01:08:46,372
We drank a little bit more.

1057
01:08:47,016 --> 01:08:48,500
Drinking is crap.

1058
01:08:52,282 --> 01:08:57,000
It was thinking ... Would like
of bringing Allison here.

1059
01:08:57,845 --> 01:09:00,469
Won't it be too much for her?

1060
01:09:01,112 --> 01:09:02,963
Would like her to see
where I live.

1061
01:09:04,051 --> 01:09:05,548
If it's ok
for you.

1062
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:07,537
Why wouldn't you be?

1063
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:10,514
Not everyone is like that.

1064
01:09:35,508 --> 01:09:36,874
Is the van yours?

1065
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:38,650
From work.

1066
01:09:39,194 --> 01:09:41,758
-What work?
-Construction.

1067
01:09:42,602 --> 01:09:44,290
I talked about it
in the letters.

1068
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:46,994
Didn't you receive it?
-I received it.

1069
01:09:48,604 --> 01:09:50,010
I didn't read them.

1070
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:54,410
-Want to go?
-Yes.

1071
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:07,136
Thank you.

1072
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,926
Life is brutal.

1073
01:11:02,808 --> 01:11:04,180
Can I drive?

1074
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:15,321
I was sacrificed by brothers

1075
01:11:15,965 --> 01:11:18,397
Crucified by lovers

1076
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:19,722
But in spite of everything ...

1077
01:11:19,723 --> 01:11:21,253
I don't hear that song
makes time.

1078
01:11:21,697 --> 01:11:23,525
Special playlist
for today.

1079
01:11:24,674 --> 01:11:26,359
What age has this thing?

1080
01:11:27,703 --> 01:11:29,239
It still works.

1081
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,295
When I have
That nebulous feeling

1082
01:11:32,596 --> 01:11:34,384
So didn't go home?

1083
01:11:35,585 --> 01:11:37,069
No.

1084
01:11:37,513 --> 01:11:38,815
Why?

1085
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,774
But it's hard
Follow believing

1086
01:11:42,775 --> 01:11:45,267
I'll even go out

1087
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:50,200
While the rain
Slaughter your hope on the ground

1088
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:55,205
And tonight
This same fall

1089
01:11:57,706 --> 01:11:59,764
Are you sure
that we can park here?

1090
01:11:59,765 --> 01:12:01,106
What are they going to do?

1091
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,791
Arrest me?

1092
01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:47,095
Olympique from Marseille!

1093
01:13:47,738 --> 01:13:49,527
Now you are even
a native.

1094
01:13:49,528 --> 01:13:52,661
Maya convinced me.
It's her favorite team.

1095
01:13:53,705 --> 01:13:55,342
Does this child have a parent?

1096
01:13:55,885 --> 01:13:57,592
He's not around.

1097
01:13:57,593 --> 01:13:59,594
Lives on a beach,
or something like that.

1098
01:13:59,937 --> 01:14:01,409
Cool.

1099
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,948
Then this woman
is it your girlfriend?

1100
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:09,147
It's not like that,
only live with them.

1101
01:14:09,591 --> 01:14:11,071
As roommates.

1102
01:14:12,937 --> 01:14:14,330
What does she do?

1103
01:14:15,262 --> 01:14:19,122
-It's a kind of actress.
-A kind of actress?

1104
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,530
Is it a striper?

1105
01:14:22,873 --> 01:14:24,266
No!

1106
01:14:26,011 --> 01:14:28,512
She just doesn't act on TV
or thing like that. She ...

1107
01:14:28,513 --> 01:14:30,133
makes theatre.

1108
01:14:30,964 --> 01:14:32,430
Theater!

1109
01:14:35,085 --> 01:14:36,835
Have you seen her act?

1110
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,948
What I'm going to do
in a fucking theater?

1111
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:44,166
It's ...

1112
01:14:51,663 --> 01:14:53,509
You know what's the worst?

1113
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,718
Never had the opportunity
of crying for her.

1114
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,484
Lina.

1115
01:15:03,605 --> 01:15:05,977
It was so intense
when we met.

1116
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,551
She was a lot of fun.

1117
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:13,233
Cool and beautiful ...

1118
01:15:17,672 --> 01:15:19,991
Then she moved,
and everything went by water below.

1119
01:15:21,415 --> 01:15:23,900
She started to sleep
with other people.

1120
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,538
As if it didn't matter.

1121
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,236
As if it were ...
just using me.

1122
01:15:34,924 --> 01:15:36,321
Or something like that.

1123
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,766
I felt so humiliated!

1124
01:15:46,544 --> 01:15:49,138
But you know,
the bad of truth is ...

1125
01:15:50,983 --> 01:15:52,929
that I just wanted to see her.

1126
01:15:56,045 --> 01:15:57,990
Just wanted to be with her.

1127
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:02,264
So much!

1128
01:16:06,508 --> 01:16:08,066
-See.
-Yes.

1129
01:16:08,545 --> 01:16:10,034
-Ready?
-Yes.

1130
01:16:10,035 --> 01:16:11,631
One, two, three!

1131
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:14,437
No, no ...

1132
01:16:15,401 --> 01:16:16,801
They arrived!

1133
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:23,154
-Hello.
-Hello.

1134
01:16:23,155 --> 01:16:24,533
This is Allison.

1135
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:26,444
Thank you, Dad.
I think she already knew.

1136
01:16:26,888 --> 01:16:30,005
-I'm Virginie.
-I'm Allison.

1137
01:16:30,006 --> 01:16:31,323
-Nice.
-Nice.

1138
01:16:31,324 --> 01:16:33,361
-Come, come in.
-Thank you.

1139
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:37,839
Maya, come say hi.
Maya? Maya?

1140
01:16:39,419 --> 01:16:40,949
Come here.

1141
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:42,674
Wait ...

1142
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:46,701
I'm sniffing something.

1143
01:16:47,658 --> 01:16:51,152
There's a little hidden animus
somewhere around here.

1144
01:16:52,584 --> 01:16:53,984
A kitten?

1145
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,672
-Do you speak French?
-Yes.

1146
01:16:57,993 --> 01:16:59,893
Of course
that I speak French.

1147
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:02,675
So you're the famous Maya.

1148
01:17:02,676 --> 01:17:04,025
Yes.

1149
01:17:04,026 --> 01:17:06,026
What's your favorite color?

1150
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:08,550
My favorite color ...

1151
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:12,123
Light blue and white.

1152
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,860
The color of the OM!

1153
01:17:13,861 --> 01:17:16,636
-Go OM!
-Go OM!

1154
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,026
Let me show you
my room.

1155
01:17:18,027 --> 01:17:19,359
Yes.

1156
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:31,581
What's the prison like?

1157
01:17:33,684 --> 01:17:35,084
Nothing good ...

1158
01:17:35,663 --> 01:17:37,063
and very hot.

1159
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:39,857
When finished,
i will do your nails.

1160
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:42,647
-My?
-Yes.

1161
01:17:42,648 --> 01:17:45,048
So will look beautiful
for when to come back.

1162
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:52,455
Hey, guys!
Dinner is on the table!

1163
01:17:56,974 --> 01:17:58,727
Watch out, it's hot.

1164
01:17:59,228 --> 01:18:03,325
-So use this.
-I get it, I get ...

1165
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:09,119
It looks good.

1166
01:18:11,584 --> 01:18:12,985
Let's pray.

1167
01:18:13,578 --> 01:18:16,105
Thank you, Lord, for this
and many other blessings.

1168
01:18:16,106 --> 01:18:18,026
Thank you for the special day
with Ally.

1169
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,059
We pray in the name of Jesus.
Amen.

1170
01:18:21,203 --> 01:18:22,504
Maya?

1171
01:18:22,847 --> 01:18:24,175
Digging.

1172
01:18:27,283 --> 01:18:29,072
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

1173
01:18:30,517 --> 01:18:31,883
Thank you.

1174
01:18:34,346 --> 01:18:36,492
Then you two
are not even having sex?

1175
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:40,288
-Allison Baker!
-What?

1176
01:18:40,289 --> 01:18:42,115
What?
You're all French now,

1177
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:44,753
thought it would be ok
talk about sex at the dinner table.

1178
01:18:45,263 --> 01:18:46,655
It was bad.

1179
01:18:47,534 --> 01:18:48,944
Is that all right?

1180
01:18:49,287 --> 01:18:50,606
The food.

1181
01:18:51,207 --> 01:18:53,260
Honestly,
it's the best meal I've had

1182
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,845
in a good time.

1183
01:18:54,846 --> 01:18:56,281
What a good one.

1184
01:18:57,313 --> 01:18:59,110
And no, we didn't have sex.

1185
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:00,560
Jesus!

1186
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,333
-Can I eat a tomato?
-You can.

1187
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:06,092
Do you like tomato?
-Yes! What about you?

1188
01:19:06,393 --> 01:19:07,809
Love it!

1189
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,960
Where did they have lunch today?

1190
01:19:09,961 --> 01:19:12,184
-Pizza.
-Pizza?

1191
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:15,443
Chez Sauveur.
My favorite pizzeria.

1192
01:19:15,444 --> 01:19:16,846
-Is it?
-Very good.

1193
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:22,582
I'm curious, why
came to study in Marseille?

1194
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:25,331
It was far.

1195
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,231
And totally different.

1196
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:32,200
And the pizza ...

1197
01:19:33,552 --> 01:19:35,352
I love pizza.

1198
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:38,062
I also like it.

1199
01:19:45,536 --> 01:19:47,036
He seems happy.

1200
01:19:49,793 --> 01:19:51,093
It's not always easy,

1201
01:19:51,094 --> 01:19:53,294
but the two
really found themselves.

1202
01:19:54,395 --> 01:19:55,795
Even?

1203
01:19:56,115 --> 01:19:57,415
Yes.

1204
01:19:57,416 --> 01:19:59,516
He seeks her at school
every day.

1205
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,440
He speaks in English
and she pretends to understand.

1206
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:04,741
It's cute.

1207
01:20:09,432 --> 01:20:10,932
You know ...

1208
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:13,454
when my mother died,

1209
01:20:14,612 --> 01:20:18,694
he put all of her stuff
in a deposit.

1210
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,750
After, when I grew up,

1211
01:20:26,651 --> 01:20:28,851
i wanted some things.

1212
01:20:30,646 --> 01:20:32,246
But when I passed
by the entrance ...

1213
01:20:33,808 --> 01:20:35,508
there was nothing else.

1214
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:38,799
He didn't pay more
the account,

1215
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,691
then ...

1216
01:20:43,086 --> 01:20:45,986
they threw it out
the things of my mother.

1217
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,426
There's nothing left of her.

1218
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:57,134
But he's here now.

1219
01:20:57,901 --> 01:20:59,501
Stayed to be close
of you.

1220
01:21:01,897 --> 01:21:04,297
Don't have many expectations
with my father.

1221
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,215
He's a stinger.

1222
01:21:09,309 --> 01:21:11,011
It's always been.

1223
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,501
It's in it.

1224
01:21:14,017 --> 01:21:16,117
I know because ...

1225
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:19,562
it's on me too.

1226
01:21:56,461 --> 01:21:58,677
It's more beautiful
on this side of the wall.

1227
01:22:05,035 --> 01:22:07,969
I liked them.
From Virginie and Maya.

1228
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,032
It's good what you have.

1229
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:12,452
I'm just trying
do the right thing.

1230
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:15,098
I'm happy for you, Dad.

1231
01:22:28,555 --> 01:22:30,160
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1232
01:22:30,161 --> 01:22:31,861
Permission to enter.

1233
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,082
How is it?

1234
01:22:44,435 --> 01:22:45,910
Very well.

1235
01:22:46,254 --> 01:22:48,888
Is it?
Was the day good?

1236
01:22:49,589 --> 01:22:50,986
Passed flying.

1237
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:57,697
Thank you.

1238
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:00,369
Why?

1239
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:03,790
For everything, I think.

1240
01:23:07,894 --> 01:23:09,661
Well ... Good night.

1241
01:23:10,105 --> 01:23:11,411
Good night.

1242
01:23:33,845 --> 01:23:35,186
Excuse me.

1243
01:23:35,187 --> 01:23:38,272
I'm Bill Baker, Allison's father
Baker, from Baumettes.

1244
01:23:53,983 --> 01:23:56,133
What was there with her?

1245
01:23:57,857 --> 01:23:59,380
What does that mean?

1246
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:04,039
Hanged. Hanged.

1247
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:13,267
We have to go now.

1248
01:24:16,088 --> 01:24:17,988
Sir, let's go.

1249
01:24:19,111 --> 01:24:20,511
Come on.

1250
01:24:21,481 --> 01:24:23,378
Let me loose!

1251
01:24:27,806 --> 01:24:29,206
You can wait here.

1252
01:24:30,542 --> 01:24:32,142
Are you okay, sir?

1253
01:24:45,025 --> 01:24:47,063
I don't abandon you,
Tu don't abandon me.

1254
01:24:47,807 --> 01:24:49,835
I don't abandon you,
Tu don't abandon me.

1255
01:24:55,036 --> 01:24:56,742
Is she okay?

1256
01:24:57,686 --> 01:24:59,027
It's stable.

1257
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:37,169
Hi, Bill!

1258
01:25:41,656 --> 01:25:43,483
I talked to Sharon again,

1259
01:25:43,484 --> 01:25:45,734
said you had come back
for here.

1260
01:25:46,535 --> 01:25:48,193
The work is going well.

1261
01:25:49,837 --> 01:25:51,483
A good team ...

1262
01:26:27,184 --> 01:26:30,074
16, 17,

1263
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:32,990
18, 16...

1264
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:34,714
Bill!

1265
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:38,404
-What, I messed up?
-Yeah, it blew it.

1266
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:44,445
" Love at first sight

1267
01:26:44,446 --> 01:26:46,551
" I was enchanted
by the way he looked at me. "

1268
01:26:46,895 --> 01:26:48,579
Lumière.

1269
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,920
Light.

1270
01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:55,857
Casquette.

1271
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,680
Boné.

1272
01:26:58,624 --> 01:27:01,359
-Glasses.
-Lunettes.

1273
01:27:02,524 --> 01:27:04,091
Thanks for the help.

1274
01:27:06,278 --> 01:27:07,778
There's no truth.

1275
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:11,151
Just stories
to count.

1276
01:27:11,672 --> 01:27:15,053
Mathilde ...
alone in that house.

1277
01:27:15,054 --> 01:27:16,835
And you --

1278
01:27:16,836 --> 01:27:20,092
the day after the accident,
sitting in the kitchen.

1279
01:27:20,093 --> 01:27:22,493
-Didn't hear ...
-Thank you, Virginie.

1280
01:27:22,986 --> 01:27:24,986
We'll take a break.

1281
01:27:25,346 --> 01:27:27,446
Virginie, it's good.

1282
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:31,091
Keep in mind
the rhythm of the lights.

1283
01:27:31,092 --> 01:27:32,443
Right.

1284
01:27:32,444 --> 01:27:34,944
Renaud, I don't know what I am
doing with the closet.

1285
01:27:34,945 --> 01:27:37,646
It's looking for, Paul.
Want to sit with others?

1286
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:40,290
No, I prefer to do something,
but that doesn't make sense.

1287
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:42,691
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

1288
01:27:42,692 --> 01:27:45,192
Paul, there is no answer
for what you're looking for.

1289
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:46,935
There's no truth.

1290
01:27:47,947 --> 01:27:49,322
Thank you.

1291
01:27:51,747 --> 01:27:53,874
So, what did you think?

1292
01:27:54,275 --> 01:27:56,203
-What did I find?
-It is.

1293
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:57,965
From the play, what did you think?

1294
01:27:58,766 --> 01:28:00,628
It was good, it's ...

1295
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:02,449
Is it? What was good?

1296
01:28:03,398 --> 01:28:04,991
Well ...

1297
01:28:06,401 --> 01:28:09,294
I have no idea.
I don't know anything about plays.

1298
01:28:09,295 --> 01:28:12,263
-And it was all in French.
-Let's go, Bill. A little something.

1299
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:17,016
No one seemed
a real person.

1300
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:19,639
-What?
-It just seemed weird.

1301
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,162
Look, certainly
was great.

1302
01:28:21,163 --> 01:28:23,765
Don't ask me.
I'm an idiot.

1303
01:28:23,766 --> 01:28:26,917
No, you're not.
And no, it wasn't great.

1304
01:28:28,449 --> 01:28:29,824
Thank you.

1305
01:28:32,418 --> 01:28:33,833
Health.

1306
01:28:35,277 --> 01:28:36,858
But I will say,
have you been ...

1307
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:38,750
very well.

1308
01:28:39,094 --> 01:28:40,574
The best thing from there.

1309
01:28:43,725 --> 01:28:46,971
So ...
I have good news.

1310
01:28:48,234 --> 01:28:49,600
I got the part.

1311
01:28:50,044 --> 01:28:51,559
On TV?

1312
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,674
-Yes, and I accepted it.
-Don't play.

1313
01:28:53,675 --> 01:28:55,283
-That's great.
-It is.

1314
01:28:55,684 --> 01:28:57,021
But ...

1315
01:28:57,365 --> 01:29:00,115
is more money,
but it's also more hours,

1316
01:29:00,116 --> 01:29:02,856
what does it mean
that I will have to pay a nanny,

1317
01:29:02,857 --> 01:29:04,684
and i will spend more time
away from the Maya.

1318
01:29:04,685 --> 01:29:06,591
I can help
with the Maya as well.

1319
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:08,410
No, you already help
o enough.

1320
01:29:08,411 --> 01:29:10,076
You have jobs.
It's busy.

1321
01:29:10,077 --> 01:29:12,062
I don't care.
I want to do it.

1322
01:29:15,887 --> 01:29:17,367
Why?

1323
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:19,687
Why?

1324
01:29:20,936 --> 01:29:22,804
I like to spend time
with her.

1325
01:29:24,605 --> 01:29:26,185
And with me too?

1326
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:29,253
Yes.

1327
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:30,959
With you too.

1328
01:29:32,326 --> 01:29:34,102
How much do you like?

1329
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:38,062
Very much.

1330
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,296
I'd say a lot.

1331
01:29:43,872 --> 01:29:46,127
It would be a big change
for us.

1332
01:29:47,728 --> 01:29:49,230
I think it would be.

1333
01:29:50,173 --> 01:29:52,098
Do you think?

1334
01:29:52,641 --> 01:29:55,039
I mean, I know.

1335
01:29:56,384 --> 01:29:59,509
And you know -- what?

1336
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,542
For the love of God!

1337
01:30:05,564 --> 01:30:06,964
-All right?
-Yes.

1338
01:30:06,965 --> 01:30:09,365
-Was that all right?
-Yes.

1339
01:30:11,099 --> 01:30:12,557
Do you have money?

1340
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:14,369
I have.

1341
01:30:15,512 --> 01:30:16,923
How much is it?

1342
01:30:21,331 --> 01:30:22,820
Sixty.

1343
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:25,022
Seriously?

1344
01:30:37,926 --> 01:30:39,506
It's your music.

1345
01:30:39,507 --> 01:30:41,102
-Is it?
-It is.

1346
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:43,173
Kind of sad, no?
Maybe I should ...

1347
01:30:43,174 --> 01:30:44,546
Hell, no!

1348
01:30:44,889 --> 01:30:47,244
-No, that's beautiful.
-Is it?

1349
01:30:47,588 --> 01:30:49,346
It's, it gives you to dance with it.

1350
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:51,070
Even?

1351
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:54,116
No, no, no. Come here.

1352
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:57,167
Come on. I'll show you.

1353
01:30:57,168 --> 01:30:59,104
-Do you show me?
-Yes, I show it.

1354
01:31:00,148 --> 01:31:02,516
Come lie next to me

1355
01:31:02,517 --> 01:31:04,231
This is Sammi Smith.

1356
01:31:06,415 --> 01:31:11,182
Until the first light of the morning

1357
01:31:12,526 --> 01:31:16,643
Everything I'm taking
It's your time

1358
01:31:18,619 --> 01:31:21,778
Help me cross
The night

1359
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:23,524
They're keeping an eye on us.

1360
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:25,961
Joshua ...

1361
01:31:26,262 --> 01:31:28,620
-Isn't it in bed?
-No.

1362
01:31:29,021 --> 01:31:31,040
-Want to dance?
-I want to.

1363
01:31:32,084 --> 01:31:33,503
Come on.

1364
01:31:37,112 --> 01:31:41,459
Let the evil assume
The Tomorrow

1365
01:31:43,178 --> 01:31:47,734
But today I need
From a friend

1366
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:49,915
Ready?

1367
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:53,188
The yesterday is dead
And buried

1368
01:31:55,556 --> 01:31:59,983
And the tomorrow away from the view

1369
01:32:01,692 --> 01:32:04,478
-I need to ask you one thing.
-What?

1370
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:06,467
Do you have even a gun?

1371
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:11,886
Two guns.

1372
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,096
Maya?

1373
01:32:48,839 --> 01:32:50,885
Can reach me
my casque?

1374
01:32:51,403 --> 01:32:53,037
-What?
-My casque,

1375
01:32:53,038 --> 01:32:54,635
my helmet,
my hard hat ...

1376
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:56,307
Can you get it for me?

1377
01:33:02,519 --> 01:33:05,119
Tickets for the game
of the OM?

1378
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,013
In the Vélodrome?

1379
01:33:07,756 --> 01:33:09,127
Yes, ma'am.

1380
01:33:09,429 --> 01:33:11,553
That!

1381
01:33:11,554 --> 01:33:15,190
I'll see the OM game
with the Bill!

1382
01:33:41,183 --> 01:33:42,484
There it goes!

1383
01:33:46,548 --> 01:33:49,419
It's him! Shirt 10!
It's Dimitri Payet.

1384
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,820
He's very good!

1385
01:33:50,821 --> 01:33:53,321
Didn't play in the World Cup
because it was bruised.

1386
01:34:26,241 --> 01:34:28,187
Man,
the place is boiling!

1387
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:32,360
-What?
-A lot of fans going crazy.

1388
01:34:34,267 --> 01:34:36,538
Someone should tell them
who are winning.

1389
01:35:28,167 --> 01:35:29,548
Right, let's go.

1390
01:36:29,308 --> 01:36:31,522
Bill.
Where are we going?

1391
01:36:32,423 --> 01:36:34,204
I think I saw a friend
of the work.

1392
01:36:34,848 --> 01:36:36,310
I want to see if it's him.

1393
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:39,814
-A friend?
-Yeah, a friend.

1394
01:37:11,941 --> 01:37:13,552
Right, let's get the van.

1395
01:37:13,553 --> 01:37:16,219
-Is it your friend?
-No, it wasn't him.

1396
01:37:20,154 --> 01:37:22,442
-How's it going?
-Well. The game is over.

1397
01:37:22,443 --> 01:37:23,910
We'll be home soon.

1398
01:37:23,911 --> 01:37:25,619
-Right, as you wish.
-Is it Mom?

1399
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,391
-It's the night of yours.
-Right.

1400
01:37:27,392 --> 01:37:29,580
I'll see you in a little bit.

1401
01:39:01,137 --> 01:39:02,586
Go back to sleep.

1402
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:04,263
Come on.

1403
01:39:04,706 --> 01:39:06,260
Let's go home.

1404
01:39:27,686 --> 01:39:29,431
Mr. Baker.

1405
01:39:29,775 --> 01:39:32,791
-Nice to see you again.
-It's late.

1406
01:39:34,693 --> 01:39:36,142
I'm sorry.

1407
01:39:38,466 --> 01:39:40,494
What can I do for you,
Mr. Baker?

1408
01:39:41,422 --> 01:39:44,628
The DNA test we talked about ...
I want to do it.

1409
01:39:45,372 --> 01:39:48,054
First I'll need
of the DNA sample.

1410
01:40:01,241 --> 01:40:03,691
I can ask
how did you get it?

1411
01:40:04,034 --> 01:40:05,693
Can you do it or not?

1412
01:40:06,336 --> 01:40:08,422
Yes, I can.

1413
01:40:09,858 --> 01:40:12,996
But I'm a former cop,
then let it say:

1414
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:15,702
it would be a big mistake
commit a crime

1415
01:40:15,703 --> 01:40:17,801
to prove innocence
of your daughter.

1416
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:20,664
That's not going to take it off
of the string.

1417
01:40:21,008 --> 01:40:23,117
And will make it arrested.
Do you understand?

1418
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:24,668
How fast do you get?

1419
01:40:26,588 --> 01:40:28,155
It's hard to say.

1420
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:31,393
One week at least,
but it will cost you.

1421
01:40:31,837 --> 01:40:33,677
Here's 3 thousand.

1422
01:40:33,678 --> 01:40:35,548
Give the other 3
when it ends,

1423
01:40:35,549 --> 01:40:37,203
but it has to be
faster.

1424
01:40:37,204 --> 01:40:40,000
Even if I hit, I still have
that to find this lad.

1425
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:43,339
-No, it doesn't.
-Do you know where he is?

1426
01:40:46,777 --> 01:40:49,680
It can disappear
before the results.

1427
01:40:49,681 --> 01:40:52,609
It won't.
Call when it's over.

1428
01:41:03,137 --> 01:41:07,014
-Don't we go to the basement?
-No, today no.

1429
01:41:07,015 --> 01:41:08,612
Come on.

1430
01:41:13,299 --> 01:41:14,866
Maya?

1431
01:41:18,136 --> 01:41:19,528
Maya?

1432
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:26,782
Maya?

1433
01:41:33,076 --> 01:41:34,469
It's a beautiful greeting.

1434
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,005
Did you see Maya?
I was in the bath.

1435
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:37,916
She's playing football
in the yard.

1436
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,344
Sorry for the delay.

1437
01:41:40,788 --> 01:41:42,421
It's all good.

1438
01:41:42,864 --> 01:41:45,314
Won't ask
of my first day at work?

1439
01:41:45,315 --> 01:41:47,125
Yes, yes ...
How was it?

1440
01:41:57,215 --> 01:42:00,188
So, how was it?

1441
01:42:00,189 --> 01:42:02,837
No. Why?
It tells me.

1442
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:06,188
Bill?

1443
01:42:06,932 --> 01:42:08,995
Who's the man in the basement?

1444
01:42:12,328 --> 01:42:13,647
In the basement?

1445
01:42:14,909 --> 01:42:16,419
With the tools.

1446
01:42:17,063 --> 01:42:18,608
I saw him.

1447
01:42:24,784 --> 01:42:26,530
I will need your help.

1448
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:28,719
Right?

1449
01:42:29,463 --> 01:42:31,222
Because it's a secret.

1450
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:33,912
Can't count
for no one.

1451
01:42:35,108 --> 01:42:36,600
Neither for your mother.

1452
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:38,576
Right?

1453
01:42:39,965 --> 01:42:41,680
It's a bad man.

1454
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:44,347
Soon he goes away.

1455
01:42:45,379 --> 01:42:47,337
It will be our secret.

1456
01:42:47,881 --> 01:42:49,278
Right?

1457
01:42:53,021 --> 01:42:54,541
That's my girl!

1458
01:43:03,987 --> 01:43:07,483
Let's not start with that.

1459
01:43:07,484 --> 01:43:10,985
The media ended her.
Poor girl.

1460
01:43:10,986 --> 01:43:13,855
They turned it
in a monster.

1461
01:43:13,856 --> 01:43:16,357
The diabolical lesbian
American.

1462
01:43:16,734 --> 01:43:18,334
Bartoli was
at the scene of the crime.

1463
01:43:18,335 --> 01:43:20,735
It was a bloodbath.
He said, not the media.

1464
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:23,886
Come on, she freaked out.
They were fighting.

1465
01:43:23,887 --> 01:43:25,887
The Arab girl
had betrayed her.

1466
01:43:25,888 --> 01:43:28,583
When you look and look like shit,
smells like shit ...

1467
01:43:28,584 --> 01:43:30,184
It's shit!

1468
01:43:30,185 --> 01:43:32,661
But the gun was never found.
The knife.

1469
01:43:33,037 --> 01:43:35,555
It has the triangulation of the cell phone.
What else do you need?

1470
01:43:35,556 --> 01:43:38,849
What about the unknown DNA? She said
who was from an Arab boy.

1471
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,347
Always have
an unknown DNA.

1472
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:44,097
The pizza guy comes into the house,
has an unknown DNA.

1473
01:43:44,098 --> 01:43:46,805
I don't know what you do
with the pizza guy, but ...

1474
01:43:46,806 --> 01:43:48,306
It was a delivery woman!

1475
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:51,463
I have no problem
in arresting Arabs, but see,

1476
01:43:51,464 --> 01:43:53,664
the boy picks
her keys,

1477
01:43:53,665 --> 01:43:55,665
and he finds the apartment
how to?

1478
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:58,604
Then stabs the girlfriend
and goes out without stealing anything?

1479
01:43:58,605 --> 01:44:01,606
She can blame the Arab,
can blame the Gaudin,

1480
01:44:01,607 --> 01:44:04,006
But she did.
She killed her girlfriend.

1481
01:44:04,007 --> 01:44:06,608
There's not what to do.
Love is that.

1482
01:44:56,336 --> 01:44:57,685
Shit.

1483
01:45:29,247 --> 01:45:31,149
In fact,
learned something new.

1484
01:45:31,993 --> 01:45:33,430
It helped me a lot.

1485
01:45:34,574 --> 01:45:36,542
Something that is called Maktub.

1486
01:45:37,085 --> 01:45:38,888
A nurse
spoke to me about it.

1487
01:45:40,232 --> 01:45:41,811
It's about acceptance.

1488
01:45:42,455 --> 01:45:44,162
Acceptance of what?

1489
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:46,573
From your destination.

1490
01:45:48,066 --> 01:45:50,607
It's helping me
to stop fighting so much.

1491
01:45:50,951 --> 01:45:53,214
Stop questioning everything.

1492
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:57,476
You simply
accept your fate

1493
01:45:58,119 --> 01:45:59,978
and learn to live in peace
with him.

1494
01:46:01,575 --> 01:46:03,425
It's a Muslim idea.

1495
01:46:04,369 --> 01:46:05,871
It's about ...

1496
01:46:06,214 --> 01:46:09,330
overcome all this ...

1497
01:46:11,411 --> 01:46:12,860
shame ...

1498
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:17,921
and guilt
that pulls you down,

1499
01:46:17,922 --> 01:46:19,898
and keep it that way,

1500
01:46:19,899 --> 01:46:23,584
and makes it feel like
so impotent.

1501
01:46:24,941 --> 01:46:27,670
And it's how I felt
for a long time.

1502
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,806
Impotent and forgetful.

1503
01:46:34,825 --> 01:46:36,240
E. ..

1504
01:46:36,763 --> 01:46:39,122
that makes life
very difficult.

1505
01:46:40,778 --> 01:46:42,424
You know what I mean?

1506
01:46:46,211 --> 01:46:48,622
But ... you're innocent.

1507
01:46:50,028 --> 01:46:52,165
So we have
that keep fighting.

1508
01:46:52,508 --> 01:46:54,955
No matter
that I am innocent, father.

1509
01:46:56,817 --> 01:46:58,862
It is not about justice,

1510
01:47:01,313 --> 01:47:03,550
but of finding peace.

1511
01:47:31,049 --> 01:47:34,269
Please listen to me.
Just listen to me.

1512
01:47:34,270 --> 01:47:36,459
I'm not a bad guy.

1513
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,760
Let me go.

1514
01:47:40,305 --> 01:47:41,787
It's not my fault.

1515
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:43,472
I don't know what you're saying,

1516
01:47:43,473 --> 01:47:45,518
but it's wasting
your breath.

1517
01:47:45,519 --> 01:47:49,631
Let's wait for DNA,
and then we'll know.

1518
01:47:50,175 --> 01:47:53,026
She asked me.
She paid me!

1519
01:47:53,469 --> 01:47:55,204
Want more water?

1520
01:47:55,205 --> 01:47:58,338
Allison, she said:
" Go. Put Lina out. "

1521
01:47:58,339 --> 01:48:00,768
-"Cash for you."
-Enough is enough!

1522
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:04,997
She told me "take this."
It gave me a necklace.

1523
01:48:04,998 --> 01:48:07,183
" Take this.
Money after. "

1524
01:48:07,184 --> 01:48:08,707
Here ... Drink this.

1525
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:10,599
Come on.

1526
01:48:11,631 --> 01:48:13,950
A necklace.
"Take it for you."

1527
01:48:14,294 --> 01:48:18,812
Necklace. Golden.
Like this one. Like this one.

1528
01:48:19,355 --> 01:48:21,461
The necklace?
I don't want that.

1529
01:48:21,462 --> 01:48:22,777
No!

1530
01:48:23,121 --> 01:48:24,570
She gave it to me.

1531
01:48:24,571 --> 01:48:27,293
She said,
" Go. Put Lina out.

1532
01:48:27,294 --> 01:48:30,152
" Necklace now.
Money after. "

1533
01:48:30,153 --> 01:48:33,474
It's not making sense.
Time to shut up.

1534
01:48:33,818 --> 01:48:35,289
Stillwater!

1535
01:48:39,349 --> 01:48:40,673
What did you say?

1536
01:48:41,216 --> 01:48:44,520
The necklace.
He says Stillwater.

1537
01:48:45,521 --> 01:48:46,893
Golden.

1538
01:48:47,336 --> 01:48:48,838
She said ...

1539
01:48:50,339 --> 01:48:53,390
" Do it.
Make her go away.

1540
01:48:54,134 --> 01:48:56,092
"Make her out."

1541
01:49:16,461 --> 01:49:17,940
Where was it?

1542
01:49:17,941 --> 01:49:20,377
I went back walking
of Baumettes.

1543
01:49:20,378 --> 01:49:22,036
We have to go see Isabelle.

1544
01:49:22,037 --> 01:49:24,016
Let's be late
if we don't go out now.

1545
01:49:24,017 --> 01:49:27,167
I -- do I have to go?

1546
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:30,218
Yes, of course.
I said you would.

1547
01:49:30,219 --> 01:49:32,442
Come on.
Hurry, please.

1548
01:49:32,443 --> 01:49:34,809
Maya, honey, calce the shoes.
Come on!

1549
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,638
Yes, Mommy.

1550
01:49:37,782 --> 01:49:42,091
So, Isabelle is a species
of godmother to us.

1551
01:49:42,535 --> 01:49:44,389
Maya loves her.

1552
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:47,199
You'll see.

1553
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,232
This is even the other side
from Marseille.

1554
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:55,822
Marraine!

1555
01:50:24,930 --> 01:50:27,145
Don't know
of what you're talking about.

1556
01:50:27,146 --> 01:50:30,086
The golden necklace that I gave her
on the day he left.

1557
01:50:30,087 --> 01:50:31,614
It Said Stillwater in it.

1558
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:34,272
Yeah, I remember that.
What does it have?

1559
01:50:34,273 --> 01:50:36,248
Remember if she wore it
at the trial?

1560
01:50:36,249 --> 01:50:37,751
Was she still with him?

1561
01:50:38,094 --> 01:50:39,835
In what is meted out
Bill?

1562
01:50:39,836 --> 01:50:42,382
When we got her things,
did you see him?

1563
01:50:42,925 --> 01:50:46,159
I don't know. I don't remember.
Why?

1564
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,917
I'll talk to you later, Sharon.
Bye.

1565
01:50:49,906 --> 01:50:51,221
All right?

1566
01:50:51,965 --> 01:50:53,980
Yes ... Everything.

1567
01:50:54,824 --> 01:50:56,374
It was talking
with Sharon.

1568
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,828
Is she okay?
-Yes, she's fine

1569
01:50:59,172 --> 01:51:00,603
What about you?

1570
01:51:00,947 --> 01:51:02,305
What do you mean?

1571
01:51:02,649 --> 01:51:04,991
You seem distracted.

1572
01:51:05,992 --> 01:51:07,755
I'm sorry.

1573
01:51:09,922 --> 01:51:11,314
I'm glad you're here.

1574
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,643
Me too.

1575
01:51:15,087 --> 01:51:16,450
You too?

1576
01:51:16,451 --> 01:51:18,452
Are you happy to be here?

1577
01:51:18,453 --> 01:51:19,898
I am.

1578
01:51:21,342 --> 01:51:22,722
Seriously.

1579
01:51:24,445 --> 01:51:25,912
Me too.

1580
01:51:27,392 --> 01:51:29,450
I like you, Bill Baker.

1581
01:51:38,694 --> 01:51:40,013
Come on.

1582
01:51:52,316 --> 01:51:54,662
Mr. Dirosa,
here is Bill Baker.

1583
01:51:54,663 --> 01:51:57,143
Need even
of that result.

1584
01:51:57,744 --> 01:51:59,424
It's kind of urgent.

1585
01:52:38,654 --> 01:52:40,526
Good morning, madame.

1586
01:52:40,969 --> 01:52:42,401
Good morning.

1587
01:52:42,402 --> 01:52:44,876
I'm from the department
of construction.

1588
01:52:44,877 --> 01:52:46,477
It's about a crack
on the facade.

1589
01:52:46,923 --> 01:52:49,423
Thought it might come
of the subsoil.

1590
01:52:49,826 --> 01:52:52,226
Noticed something unfussy about there
recently.

1591
01:52:52,227 --> 01:52:54,427
Unfussy? In the basement?

1592
01:52:54,944 --> 01:52:58,298
Anything.
A noise, an odor?

1593
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:01,019
-Should I worry?
-No, no ...

1594
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:02,920
It's just routine check-up.

1595
01:53:03,875 --> 01:53:05,575
Do you use the basement?

1596
01:53:06,084 --> 01:53:08,084
Me? No.

1597
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Some other person in the building,
maybe?

1598
01:53:14,559 --> 01:53:19,133
I can find out and call,
if you give me your card.

1599
01:53:19,576 --> 01:53:21,676
It will not be necessary.

1600
01:53:21,677 --> 01:53:23,477
You helped a lot, madame.

1601
01:53:25,397 --> 01:53:28,208
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

1602
01:53:51,587 --> 01:53:54,709
You know, I also used to fight
at school when he was a child.

1603
01:53:55,453 --> 01:53:58,156
But that's not good.
Fight? No!

1604
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:00,030
It's not good.

1605
01:54:01,881 --> 01:54:03,626
Are you sure
of who doesn't want to?

1606
01:54:05,506 --> 01:54:09,314
The man in the basement ...
Will you kill him?

1607
01:54:09,315 --> 01:54:12,426
What? No!
Of course not!

1608
01:54:14,992 --> 01:54:16,392
Listen.

1609
01:54:18,432 --> 01:54:22,480
Would ever do something to hurt
you and your mother. Ever.

1610
01:54:23,192 --> 01:54:24,592
Ever.

1611
01:54:25,505 --> 01:54:27,376
Because I love you both.

1612
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,187
Very much.

1613
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:31,998
Love.

1614
01:54:35,044 --> 01:54:36,877
Just need to trust me.

1615
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:38,596
Right?

1616
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:42,348
Right.

1617
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:08,334
Mr. Baker,
a word, please.

1618
01:55:08,677 --> 01:55:10,161
Police.

1619
01:55:10,162 --> 01:55:12,278
I can see your identity,
Please?

1620
01:55:12,821 --> 01:55:14,767
Your identity,
Mr. Baker.

1621
01:55:20,089 --> 01:55:21,482
Thank you.

1622
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,895
Take off your cap.

1623
01:55:27,936 --> 01:55:30,056
Right. Thank you.

1624
01:55:31,479 --> 01:55:32,876
Well, Mr. Baker,

1625
01:55:32,877 --> 01:55:35,447
my colleagues will take the little girl
to the inside.

1626
01:55:35,448 --> 01:55:36,802
Right?

1627
01:55:36,803 --> 01:55:38,624
-No, Bill.
-All right, all right ...

1628
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:40,122
It's all good.
All right.

1629
01:55:40,123 --> 01:55:41,583
-Go with her.
-No.

1630
01:55:41,584 --> 01:55:43,138
It's going to be all right.

1631
01:55:43,139 --> 01:55:44,526
All right.

1632
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:48,634
It's all good.

1633
01:55:48,635 --> 01:55:50,537
Mr. Baker,
look at me.

1634
01:55:52,391 --> 01:55:54,541
Do you have a basement here?

1635
01:55:56,343 --> 01:55:57,910
Yes or no?

1636
01:55:59,689 --> 01:56:01,264
-Yes, sir.
-Right.

1637
01:56:01,265 --> 01:56:03,132
Give me the keys, please.

1638
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:12,230
I'll check it.

1639
01:56:24,459 --> 01:56:27,004
-All right.
-Please.

1640
01:56:43,041 --> 01:56:44,412
Stop it.

1641
01:56:45,092 --> 01:56:46,492
I'll check it.

1642
01:56:57,133 --> 01:56:58,433
Nothing.

1643
01:57:03,205 --> 01:57:04,585
Stop it.

1644
01:57:18,461 --> 01:57:20,361
Has a padlock
in the latter.

1645
01:57:21,067 --> 01:57:22,429
Do you have the key?

1646
01:57:23,630 --> 01:57:25,163
Mr. Baker.

1647
01:57:25,606 --> 01:57:27,060
It's with him.

1648
01:57:27,942 --> 01:57:29,542
It's in the locksmith.

1649
01:57:47,126 --> 01:57:48,426
I didn't find anything.

1650
01:57:51,845 --> 01:57:53,543
Let's go up.

1651
01:58:01,149 --> 01:58:02,534
Sit down.

1652
01:58:05,155 --> 01:58:07,155
We vasculate.
We found nothing.

1653
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:09,660
She said
who doesn't know anything.

1654
01:58:11,899 --> 01:58:14,599
If it matters if we interrogate
your daughter?

1655
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:16,439
Yeah, I care.

1656
01:58:16,799 --> 01:58:18,199
She's 9 years old.

1657
01:58:20,354 --> 01:58:22,754
Prefer
come to the police station?

1658
01:58:30,485 --> 01:58:31,785
Is it Maya?

1659
01:58:34,514 --> 01:58:35,889
Come on.

1660
01:58:38,927 --> 01:58:40,433
Go, baby.

1661
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:51,051
Bill lives here, with you
and your mother? Is that it?

1662
01:58:53,121 --> 01:58:54,421
Look at me.

1663
01:58:55,348 --> 01:58:56,649
Yes.

1664
01:58:56,984 --> 01:58:58,984
Is he nice to you?

1665
01:58:59,887 --> 01:59:01,384
Yes.

1666
01:59:07,529 --> 01:59:09,429
Have you been in the basement?

1667
01:59:10,668 --> 01:59:12,017
Yes.

1668
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:15,381
What do you do there?

1669
01:59:16,072 --> 01:59:19,472
We organize the tools.
I teach French for the Bill.

1670
01:59:23,662 --> 01:59:27,262
And when it was the last time
who has been in the basement?

1671
01:59:28,489 --> 01:59:29,989
Yesterday.

1672
01:59:31,217 --> 01:59:32,617
Yesterday?

1673
01:59:35,069 --> 01:59:36,669
And was everything normal?

1674
01:59:40,934 --> 01:59:43,134
You know Allison,
the daughter of the Bill?

1675
01:59:44,371 --> 01:59:46,271
Yes. She's in prison.

1676
01:59:48,396 --> 01:59:50,696
Doesn't want the Bill
go to prison, no?

1677
01:59:52,461 --> 01:59:53,836
No.

1678
01:59:53,837 --> 01:59:56,014
-Why do you like him?
-Yes.

1679
01:59:58,184 --> 01:59:59,584
Now listen well ...

1680
02:00:00,781 --> 02:00:02,781
If you lie to me,

1681
02:00:03,104 --> 02:00:04,604
i'll know.

1682
02:00:05,099 --> 02:00:08,899
And I'll have to put the Bill
in prison.

1683
02:00:09,339 --> 02:00:10,739
Did you understand?

1684
02:00:12,004 --> 02:00:14,104
Let me repeat
the question.

1685
02:00:15,789 --> 02:00:19,589
When it was in the basement
the last time?

1686
02:00:23,291 --> 02:00:24,691
Yesterday.

1687
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,488
Right. Come on.

1688
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:02,510
Did you let go of him? The man?

1689
02:01:04,966 --> 02:01:06,466
Go to your room.

1690
02:01:07,318 --> 02:01:08,818
Go!

1691
02:01:16,036 --> 02:01:18,783
-Virginie, I didn't want to ...
-How did you find it?

1692
02:01:20,954 --> 02:01:22,469
Pure chance.

1693
02:01:22,912 --> 02:01:24,566
In the football game.

1694
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:27,400
With Maya?

1695
02:01:34,999 --> 02:01:36,814
Did you ask her to lie?

1696
02:01:38,567 --> 02:01:40,065
Did you ask?

1697
02:01:41,298 --> 02:01:43,923
Never wanted to involve you
or Maya.

1698
02:01:47,925 --> 02:01:49,522
-I know ...
-You ...

1699
02:01:51,524 --> 02:01:53,121
You have to go now.

1700
02:01:57,046 --> 02:01:59,724
Right. Pack your bags.
You go away.

1701
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:14,552
Can I come in?

1702
02:02:20,827 --> 02:02:22,294
Maya?

1703
02:02:27,734 --> 02:02:29,436
Don't want to talk to me?

1704
02:02:31,142 --> 02:02:32,526
All right.

1705
02:02:35,568 --> 02:02:37,065
Sorry.

1706
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:43,145
I'm sorry.

1707
02:02:49,956 --> 02:02:51,431
I love you.

1708
02:03:23,659 --> 02:03:25,009
Bill!

1709
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:27,072
Don't ...

1710
02:03:27,073 --> 02:03:29,173
Go give bye to the Bill!

1711
02:03:30,691 --> 02:03:32,191
Go, Maya, go!

1712
02:04:21,278 --> 02:04:22,657
Mr. Baker,

1713
02:04:22,658 --> 02:04:25,460
i have news
extraordinary.

1714
02:04:25,461 --> 02:04:28,154
The judge in your daughter's case
called me this morning

1715
02:04:28,155 --> 02:04:30,037
New evidence has emerged.

1716
02:04:30,038 --> 02:04:31,939
It looks like a cop
retired

1717
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:35,160
appeared with a combination
for the unknown DNA.

1718
02:04:35,161 --> 02:04:38,120
Also combines with a sample
that the police have collected

1719
02:04:38,121 --> 02:04:40,134
of a robbery
four years ago,

1720
02:04:40,135 --> 02:04:41,536
after the trial.

1721
02:04:41,937 --> 02:04:43,586
Got him?

1722
02:04:43,587 --> 02:04:45,124
No, not yet.

1723
02:04:45,667 --> 02:04:49,162
But everything we need to prove
is the sufficient doubt.

1724
02:04:49,163 --> 02:04:51,760
So, even if they don't find it
the suspect,

1725
02:04:51,761 --> 02:04:54,336
there is a real chance
that they let go of Allison.

1726
02:04:54,837 --> 02:04:59,481
In fact, the judge has already agreed
in reopening the investigation,

1727
02:04:59,482 --> 02:05:02,014
which is almost a miracle.

1728
02:05:02,758 --> 02:05:05,465
I think that just happens
in Marseille.

1729
02:05:12,403 --> 02:05:14,327
Thank you for coming to tell me,
lady.

1730
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:18,856
Mr. Baker, this is the best
result possible

1731
02:05:18,857 --> 02:05:21,560
for your family.
Do you understand?

1732
02:05:22,303 --> 02:05:23,818
I understand.

1733
02:05:24,663 --> 02:05:26,143
Thank you, lady.

1734
02:05:52,343 --> 02:05:53,866
Go, Pokes!

1735
02:05:58,218 --> 02:06:01,050
I said we would bring
our girl home,

1736
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:03,288
and it was exactly
what we did.

1737
02:06:07,184 --> 02:06:08,855
Welcome to the home, Allison.

1738
02:06:10,417 --> 02:06:12,171
Welcome back
the Oklahoma.

1739
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:15,017
Welcome back
to America!

1740
02:07:05,024 --> 02:07:06,765
Is it being antisocial?

1741
02:07:12,605 --> 02:07:14,015
Are you okay?

1742
02:07:20,444 --> 02:07:23,186
On the day he left
for Marseille,

1743
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:26,389
Sharon and I took her
to the airport and ...

1744
02:07:27,033 --> 02:07:28,818
when we got there,

1745
02:07:29,862 --> 02:07:34,126
was ashamed for not having
a gift or nothing, so ...

1746
02:07:34,470 --> 02:07:36,429
i went
up to the gift shop.

1747
02:07:37,230 --> 02:07:40,886
I thought I'd buy you a book,
a locksmith or anything.

1748
02:07:41,874 --> 02:07:43,719
So I saw this necklace.

1749
02:07:45,834 --> 02:07:49,808
I thought it would be a bit of a little bit
from home to take with you.

1750
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,546
It was golden.

1751
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:55,261
It Said Stillwater in it.

1752
02:08:09,262 --> 02:08:11,678
Didn't want
that that happened.

1753
02:08:15,377 --> 02:08:20,660
He said he would only help me
taking her out of the apartment.

1754
02:08:22,188 --> 02:08:24,856
Didn't want
that she died.

1755
02:08:26,566 --> 02:08:28,225
I loved her.

1756
02:08:29,748 --> 02:08:31,380
I know I do.

1757
02:08:33,952 --> 02:08:35,954
Think I'm a monster?

1758
02:08:37,346 --> 02:08:38,978
You're my daughter.
I --

1759
02:08:39,922 --> 02:08:41,581
could ever find that.

1760
02:08:44,397 --> 02:08:46,778
Dad, what's wrong
with us?

1761
02:08:49,942 --> 02:08:52,040
I don't know, little girl.

1762
02:08:52,784 --> 02:08:54,242
I don't know.

1763
02:08:55,186 --> 02:08:58,907
I'm sorry. Much!

1764
02:09:00,408 --> 02:09:02,450
I'm sorry.

1765
02:09:06,828 --> 02:09:08,152
Me too.

1766
02:09:53,597 --> 02:09:56,904
Take the ribbon out of my hair

1767
02:09:59,672 --> 02:10:04,042
Shake it and drop it

1768
02:10:05,944 --> 02:10:09,869
Put it gently
About your skin

1769
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:15,975
Like the shadows on the wall

1770
02:10:22,526 --> 02:10:23,953
Good morning.

1771
02:10:29,719 --> 02:10:31,186
I couldn't sleep.

1772
02:10:32,361 --> 02:10:34,116
I went hiking, and ...

1773
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:36,492
ended up here.

1774
02:10:39,891 --> 02:10:41,358
Glad you did that.

1775
02:10:47,102 --> 02:10:48,543
Do you miss them?

1776
02:10:53,034 --> 02:10:54,458
I feel.

1777
02:10:56,568 --> 02:10:58,017
Can you go back?

1778
02:10:59,663 --> 02:11:01,147
No, I can't.

1779
02:11:04,076 --> 02:11:05,691
But it was good.

1780
02:11:06,034 --> 02:11:07,506
It doesn't change that.

1781
02:11:12,924 --> 02:11:14,391
Sorry.

1782
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:19,065
Life is brutal.

1783
02:11:36,913 --> 02:11:38,937
Everything looks equal here.

1784
02:11:41,287 --> 02:11:42,958
Nothing has changed.

1785
02:11:45,347 --> 02:11:46,814
Don't you think?

1786
02:11:50,818 --> 02:11:52,764
No, Ally, I don't think so.

1787
02:11:55,370 --> 02:11:57,290
Everything looks different
for me.

1788
02:11:59,305 --> 02:12:01,529
I can hardly recognize it.

1789
02:12:12,538 --> 02:12:17,538
